PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the provided transcript, there is no specific evidence presented by Detective Chief Inspector Gregory Purser that directly supports the police's version of events. The conversation appears to be focused on explaining the principles and objectives of a MASTS operation, as well as discussing the desired outcomes for the operation.

However, it can be inferred from the testimony that the police's version of events is that they were attempting to prevent Jean Charles de Menezes from boarding public transportation, possibly to gain intelligence or make an arrest. The detective's comments and Purser's responses suggest that the primary goal was to stop de Menezes before he got on a bus or tube train.

It's important to note that this transcript is part of a larger legal proceeding, likely an inquest or inquiry into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes. Further evidence and testimony may be presented to support or challenge the police's version of events.
