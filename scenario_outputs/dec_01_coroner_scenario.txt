RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. The jury has a juror who needs to leave the country for personal reasons, which may impact the deliberation process.
2. The coroner is inclined to ask the juror to remain until the last moment, rather than releasing them mid-deliberation.
3. The coroner agrees with this proposal and will inform the other jurors that they can continue deliberating even after the juror leaves.

These findings are relevant to the coroner's decision-making in terms of managing the jury process and ensuring a fair and impartial verdict.
