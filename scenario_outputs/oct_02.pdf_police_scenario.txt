PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, it appears that the evidence supporting the police's version of events is the testimony of Detective Chief Superintendent Jon Boutcher. Specifically:

* He took full responsibility for the decisions made during the operation, alongside Commander Dick.
* He agreed with every decision she made and was aware that he could challenge her if needed.
* He described Commander Dick as "exemplary" and stated that he was fortunate to have had her as a DSO (Designated Senior Officer).
* He emphasized the competence and quality of the team assembled in the operations room, stating that they were the best and most experienced officers available.
* He highlighted Commander Dick's calmness and decision-making capabilities as key factors in her suitability for the role of DSO.

It is likely that the police will rely on this testimony to support their version of events, particularly with regards to the decisions made during the operation.
