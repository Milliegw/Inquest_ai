PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, it appears that the police's version of events is supported by the following evidence:

1. Surveillance log: The surveillance log shows that JC left the number 2 bus at 9:48 and then reboarded the same bus at a stop further down the road at 9:52.
2. Mr. Cremin's log: Mr. Cremin's log (page 164) indicates that he followed the surveillance team into the station, entered the tube, sat inside, was confronted by SO19, and was shot in the head. The log also mentions that the information came from SO19.

It is worth noting that the transcript does not provide any direct evidence to contradict the police's version of events, but rather presents their account through the testimony of Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick.
