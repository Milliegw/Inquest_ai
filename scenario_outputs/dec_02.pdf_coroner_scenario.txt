PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on Sir Michael Wright's summing-up, here are the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making:

1. The evidence is for the jury to decide what is relevant and significant, not for the coroner to determine.
2. The jury must consider all the evidence presented over 36 days of testimony.
3. The coroner will summarize the facts but will not repeat all the evidence heard during the inquest.
4. The transcript of the evidence will be available for the jury's deliberations if needed.
5. The jury is responsible for deciding what witnesses are honest, accurate, and reliable.

These findings highlight the importance of the jury's role in evaluating the evidence and making a decision about the verdicts.
