PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the provided transcript, there is no direct evidence presented by Mr. Mansfield or Sir Michael Wright that specifically supports the police's version of events. The submissions made by Mr. Mansfield appear to focus on the narrative aspect of the inquest and present questions related to factual and contributory factors surrounding the incident.

It seems that the main thrust of Mr. Mansfield's argument is to provide a distillation of the law and facts as submitted, with a focus on the narrative rather than specific verdicts. He does not explicitly reference evidence or supporting materials that would directly corroborate the police's version of events.

If you are looking for evidence that supports the police's version of events, you may need to review other documents or transcripts from earlier in the inquest process or seek out additional information separately.
