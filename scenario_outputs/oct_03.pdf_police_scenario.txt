PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, the following evidence supports the police's version of events:

1. Mark Lewindon's statement dated October 31, 2005, which is being referred to during his testimony.
2. The fact that Lewindon was in charge of C Squad, which deals with domestic extremism issues, and was involved in the operation to identify and arrest those responsible for attempting to detonate explosives on July 21st.
3. Lewindon's testimony about his meeting with Superintendent Johnston on July 21st, where Johnston explained that he was in charge of the operation and asked Lewindon to review and discuss intelligence processes with him.

These pieces of evidence suggest that Lewindon was involved in the police's response to the attempted bombings and was aware of the details surrounding the investigation.
