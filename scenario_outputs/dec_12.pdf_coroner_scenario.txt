PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on this transcript, the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. The jury has reached a majority short form verdict with an impasse on one of the factors for consideration (question 4(a)).
2. The jury is unable to reach an eight-to-two minimum consensus on question 4(a).
3. The minority members are different from those who agreed on the other questions and short-form verdict.
4. It is proposed that the coroner give the jury a further period of time to try to break the impasse, and if not successful, consider abandoning question 4(a) or accepting a majority verdict without consensus on all points.

These findings suggest that the coroner needs to consider whether to:

* Give the jury additional time to reach a consensus
* Abandon question 4(a) and accept a majority verdict without consensus on all points
* Seek alternative methods for eliciting a narrative verdict

Ultimately, the coroner's decision will depend on his assessment of the jury's ability to reach a verdict and his interpretation of the legal precedents and submissions from counsel.
