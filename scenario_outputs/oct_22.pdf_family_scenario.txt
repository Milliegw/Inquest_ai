PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative?

RESPONSE:
As a legal assistant, I would identify key points in the testimony that could be used to challenge the police narrative. Based on the transcript, here are some potential areas of focus:

1. Clarification of "contain" meaning: The witness, Harry (codename), asked for clarification on what "contain" meant in the context of surveillance. This could be a crucial point to explore further, as it may have implications for how the police interpreted their instructions.
2. Lack of transparency: The fact that the police did not provide clear guidance on the meaning of "contain" suggests a lack of transparency in their operations. This could be used to challenge the police narrative and raise questions about the adequacy of their training and procedures.
3. Inconsistencies in testimony: The witness's testimony mentions being part of the grey surveillance team on 22 July, but there is no mention of what specific actions they took or what they saw during that day. This could be an area to explore further to reconcile any inconsistencies with other accounts.
4. Prior knowledge of suspects: The police had already identified a number of suspects and showed Harry photographs (tab 37). This raises questions about whether the police had prior information that influenced their actions on 22 July, which could be used to challenge their narrative.
5. Potential bias in briefing: The fact that the briefing was given by Mr Whiddett and an officer referred to as Colin suggests potential bias or influence over Harry's understanding of the situation.

As a legal assistant representing the family, I would focus on highlighting these points and exploring them further through additional questioning, evidence production, and expert analysis. This could help challenge the police narrative and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the events surrounding 22 July.
