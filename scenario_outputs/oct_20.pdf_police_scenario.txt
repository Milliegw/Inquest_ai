PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
As an expert legal assistant, I can identify some key points that support the police's version of events:

1. The witness (Derek) provides details about his actions on the morning of October 20, 2008, including:
	* Establishing bus stops in the vicinity and checking one specific stop in Roupell Road.
	* Identifying a potential holding area at the TA Centre and a communal door for 21 Scotia.
	* Noticing a car of interest parked near the communal door.
2. Derek confirms that he relayed this information back to the operations room before 7 o'clock, although he can't specify the exact time.
3. The witness's role in surveillance is explained as establishing parameters for the movement of potential suspects and identifying weaknesses to complete the task.
4. The concern about ensuring a suspect with or without a rucksack did not get on public transport is acknowledged by Derek.

These points suggest that the police had a reasonable understanding of the situation on the ground, including the location of bus stops, potential holding areas, and the presence of suspicious vehicles.
