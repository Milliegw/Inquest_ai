PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, it appears that the evidence supporting the police's version of events is not explicitly stated in this particular section. However, earlier in the proceeding, Chief Superintendent William Tillbrook and Mr. Mansfield (the lawyer) discussed various aspects of the police investigation and protocols, including debriefing and examining every operation undertaken by CO19.

It can be inferred that the evidence supporting the police's version of events might include:

1. Witness statements: The police may have gathered eyewitness accounts from individuals who witnessed the shooting.
2. Forensic evidence: The transcript does not explicitly mention forensic evidence, but it is possible that physical evidence was collected at the scene and analyzed to support the police's version of events.
3. Video footage: There might be video recordings of the incident, which could provide visual evidence supporting the police's account.
4. Police protocols and procedures: As discussed in the transcript, the police may have followed established protocols and procedures during their investigation, which could provide a framework for understanding their actions on the day of the shooting.
5. Training and expertise: The fact that CO19 officers are highly trained and professional people could be seen as evidence supporting their version of events.

It is important to note that these inferences are based on this specific transcript and may not reflect the complete picture of the evidence presented during the trial.
