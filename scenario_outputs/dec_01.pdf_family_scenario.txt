PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative?

RESPONSE:
As a legal assistant representing the family, I would focus on the following evidence to challenge the police narrative:

1. Commander Stewart's statement: Since Commander Stewart has provided a thorough statement on the Metropolitan Police response and any steps taken, I would scrutinize this document for inconsistencies, contradictions, or omissions that could undermine the police narrative.
2. Juror's personal commitment: The fact that one of the jurors has a personal commitment to leave the country after a certain date (December 11th) raises questions about potential bias or influence on the jury's deliberations. I would investigate this further to determine if there are any concerns regarding the juror's ability to remain impartial.
3. Previous cases: The discussion about previous cases where jurors had to leave during deliberation suggests that similar issues may have arisen in other trials. I would research these cases and highlight any similarities or differences that could support or challenge the police narrative.
4. Jury instructions: As the judge noted, it's essential to ensure that the jury understands their role and responsibilities throughout the trial. I would review the jury instructions provided by the court to determine if they adequately address potential concerns regarding juror bias or influence.
5. Witness statements: I would focus on witness statements that contradict the police narrative or raise questions about the investigation's thoroughness. This could include witnesses who were involved in the events leading up to the incident, those who may have been influenced by external factors, or individuals with alternative explanations for what happened.

By examining these areas of evidence, I believe it would be possible to challenge the police narrative and argue that their version of events is not supported by the facts.
