PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative?

RESPONSE:
As an expert legal assistant, my task is to identify potential weaknesses in the police narrative and highlight them as areas of concern for the family. Based on the transcript, here are some key points I would focus on:

1. Delayed response: The police took several hours to obtain photographs from the DVLA, despite having received instructions at 4 am. This raises questions about their efficiency and effectiveness in responding to critical information.
2. Inaccurate information: Detective Chief Inspector Southworth initially stated that the MPS/DVLA designated point of contact was not accessible outside office hours. However, he later corrected this statement based on new evidence from Detective Constable Martin Edwards. This inconsistency highlights a lack of transparency and potentially intentional misinformation.
3. Lack of direct involvement: DCI Southworth admitted that he was not directly involved in conducting DVLA checks. This raises concerns about his credibility as an eyewitness to the events surrounding Osman's photo request.
4. Delayed receipt of photographs: The photographs from the DVLA did not arrive until midday on July 22, which is after the shooting incident in Stockwell. This delay could have had significant consequences for the investigation and potentially affected the outcome.

As a legal assistant representing the family, I would focus on these points to challenge the police narrative:

* Questioning the credibility of DCI Southworth's evidence, given his initial inaccurate statement and lack of direct involvement in conducting DVLA checks.
* Highlighting the delay in responding to critical information from the DVLA and how this could have impacted the investigation.
* Using Detective Constable Martin Edwards' corrected statement to demonstrate that the police had access to accurate information about the DVLA's designated point of contact outside office hours.

By focusing on these points, I would aim to raise concerns about the police's handling of the investigation and potentially create a narrative that undermines their credibility.
