PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative?

RESPONSE:
As a legal assistant, my role is to provide guidance and support to lawyers, including those representing families in cases like this. Based on the transcript, it appears that the police are presenting their version of events through witness testimony. As an attorney representing the family, I would focus on gathering and presenting evidence to challenge the police narrative.

Some potential lines of inquiry could include:

1. Investigating alternative explanations for the events: Challenge the police's account by exploring other possible scenarios or motives that may have led to the events in question.
2. Highlighting inconsistencies in witness testimony: Analyze the testimony of each witness, including Bernard, and identify any inconsistencies or contradictions that could be used to undermine their credibility.
3. Uncovering potential biases or motivations: Examine the background and potential biases of each witness, including Bernard, to determine if they may have had a motive to present certain information in a particular way.
4. Presenting alternative evidence: Gather and present physical evidence, such as security footage, audio recordings, or other tangible items that could contradict the police's account or provide alternative explanations for what happened.

Some specific pieces of evidence that I might focus on include:

1. Any inconsistencies between Bernard's testimony and other available evidence.
2. The timing and circumstances surrounding Bernard's statements in January 2006 and the recent statement.
3. Any potential biases or motivations that may have influenced Bernard's account, such as his rank or role within SO12 at the time.
4. Physical evidence that contradicts Bernard's testimony or provides alternative explanations for what happened.

Ultimately, my goal would be to challenge the police narrative by presenting a comprehensive and compelling case that highlights inconsistencies and uncertainties in their version of events, while also providing alternative explanations and evidence that support the family's perspective.
