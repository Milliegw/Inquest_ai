PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
As an expert legal assistant, I can analyze the transcript and identify the evidence presented in this excerpt that supports the police's version of events.

The key piece of evidence mentioned is the "command structure document" provided to the jury. This simplified diagram shows the hierarchy of command during the operations on Scotia Road and Portnall Road, with Mr. McDowall, Commander Dick, and Silver Commanders Boutcher and others involved in the control structure.

Additionally, Peter Clarke's testimony as a retired Assistant Commissioner for Specialist Operations (SO13) provides insight into the police's version of events. His experience and involvement with SO13 since 2002 suggest that he was part of the team responsible for investigating and responding to terrorist threats, including those related to the operations in question.

While this excerpt does not explicitly present evidence supporting the police's version of events, it sets the stage for further testimony and potentially provides a framework for understanding the command structure and hierarchy involved in the operations.
