2. The coroner proposed leaving two short-form verdicts (lawful killing and open verdict) to the jury.
3. Interested Persons, including the de Menezes family and officers C2 and C12, made submissions on the wording of the questions.
4. The coroner entertained those submissions and revised the Verdict Questionnaire.
5. The de Menezes family issued a judicial review claim and application for a stay of the Inquest, which was subsequently refused by Mr Justice Silber.
