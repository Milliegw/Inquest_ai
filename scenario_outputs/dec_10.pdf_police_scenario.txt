PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
There is no evidence presented in this transcript that specifically supports the police's version of events. This appears to be a trial procedure, where the judge (SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT) is directing the jury on their deliberations and providing guidance on reaching a verdict. The focus is on the majority verdict rule and the jury's deliberation process, rather than presenting evidence supporting any particular party's version of events.
