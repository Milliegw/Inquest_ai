PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the witness statement of Detective Inspector Merrick Rose, the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. Detective Inspector Rose has a copy of his own witness statements from December 21, 2005, and July 20, 2006.
2. He has a blue book containing notes made during an armed operation, which is recorded on Form 3605.
3. In July 2005, Detective Inspector Rose was an IFCAT inspector, having completed the necessary training in 2004.
4. As an IFCAT inspector, he would have been qualified to Silver firearms operations.
5. Between July 2004 and July 2005, Detective Inspector Rose estimated that he had conducted about six firearms operations.

These findings may be relevant to the coroner's decision-making as they provide insight into Detective Inspector Rose's qualifications, training, and experience in handling firearms operations around the time of the attempted suicide bombings on July 21, 2005.
