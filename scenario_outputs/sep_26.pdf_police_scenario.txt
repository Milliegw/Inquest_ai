PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the provided transcript, the police's version of events is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the police were conducting surveillance outside a block of flats on Scotia Road, including number 21. The Deputy Assistant Commissioner, John McDowall, was questioned by Sir Michael Wright and later by David Perry.

The evidence supporting the police's version of events includes:

1. The presence of Frank keeping watch from the van outside Scotia Road.
2. The possibility that Frank may have had a backup or deputy, but there is no confirmation of this.
3. The fact that the intelligence unit would have researched who was living in each flat by consulting the voters' register.

It can be inferred that the police were trying to identify the occupants of number 21 Scotia Road and possibly other flats in the block.
