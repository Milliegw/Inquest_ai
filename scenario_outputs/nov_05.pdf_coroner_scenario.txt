1. The deceased, Jean Charles de Menezes, was pursued by armed police officers as part of an emergency response related to the planting of bombs on public transport in London.
2. De Menezes vaulted over the ticket barrier at Stockwell tube station and ran downstairs onto a train, where he appeared to stumble before being immobilized by the police.
