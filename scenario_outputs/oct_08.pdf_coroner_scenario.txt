PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, here are the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making:

1. Identification was being firmed up around 9:52 am on the day of the shooting, but surveillance officers did not all have copies of CCTV footage or the gym card photograph at that time.
2. The policy on identification has likely remained unchanged since then.
3. Commissioner Dick has been involved in a continuous overview of the implications for policing of the Stockwell operation and other events in July 2005, including since the trial verdict.
4. There have been numerous changes and improvements in the Met since 2005 as a result of these events.

These findings may be relevant to the coroner's decision-making in determining whether there were any systemic or procedural issues that contributed to the shooting. The coroner may also consider the Commissioner's involvement in reviewing and implementing changes to policing procedures since the trial verdict, which could inform their conclusions about the adequacy of police procedures on the day of the shooting.
