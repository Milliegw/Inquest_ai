PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, the evidence supporting the police's version of events includes:

1. Surveillance footage (CCTV film) which suggests that James and Lawrence were in the car together at some point between 9:50 and 9:57 am.
2. The testimony of James himself, who states that he was planning to drop off Lawrence to catch the bus around this time.

These pieces of evidence support the police's contention that James and Lawrence were indeed in the same vehicle during this timeframe, which is important for understanding the events that unfolded.
