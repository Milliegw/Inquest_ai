PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, it appears that Detective Sergeant Piers Dingemans' testimony is intended to support the police's version of events on July 22, 2005. Specifically:

1. He confirms his role as the head of an arrest team comprising himself and three detective constables (DC Hillier, DC Braithwaite, and DC McAuley) that day.
2. He states that he and his colleagues were unarmed and in plain clothes.
3. He mentions making multiple witness statements about the events that day, including one shortly after the incident and subsequent statements.

Dingemans' testimony also touches on the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the investigation, highlighting the exceptional hours worked by police officers in the aftermath of the 7 July bombings. His experience working on the failed bombing investigations the previous day is also mentioned as relevant context.

It's likely that Dingemans' testimony serves to establish the police's account of events on July 22, 2005, and to provide insight into the operational procedures and personnel involved in the investigation at the time.
