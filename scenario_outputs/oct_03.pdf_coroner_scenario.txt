RESPONSE:
Based on the testimony of Mr. Mark Lewindon, the main findings relevant to the Coroner's decision-making are:

1. On July 22, 2005, Mr. Lewindon was a Detective Chief Inspector in the Metropolitan Police Service, working in the Special Branch and specifically heading C Squad, which deals with domestic extremism.
2. He began his duty that day at 9:00 am.
3. He had arranged to meet Superintendent Johnston, who was seconded from C Squad to lead an operation to identify and arrest individuals involved in a failed bombing attempt on July 21, 2005.
4. Mr. Lewindon's planned meeting with Superintendent Johnston was intended to review the intelligence processes and ensure that the right information was being shared.

These findings provide context for the events of July 22, 2005, which are likely to be relevant to the Coroner's investigation into the death(s) under inquiry.
