PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. An incident occurred outside the Oval where a photographer attempted to take a photo of an anonymized witness or witnesses arriving/departing the premises.
2. The coroner (SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT) warned that any attempt to breach the order protecting the anonymity of the witnesses would be considered contempt of court and may result in serious consequences for the photographer and their editor.
3. The police will take no further action against the individual involved in the incident, but the coroner's warning remains in place.
4. To prevent similar incidents in the future, barriers will be placed at the witness entrance gate to block photographers from getting too close.
5. The coroner left it to the discretion of the chief officers of the police to decide what action to take if a photographer attempts to breach the barrier.

These findings are relevant to the coroner's decision-making because they relate to the protection of anonymized witnesses and the potential consequences for those who attempt to breach that protection.
