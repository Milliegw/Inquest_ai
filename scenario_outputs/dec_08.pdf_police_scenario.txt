PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
There is no direct evidence presented in this transcript that specifically supports the police's version of events. This transcript appears to be related to jury deliberations and court proceedings, rather than presenting evidence or testimony from witnesses.

However, it can be inferred that the prosecution has presented some form of evidence or testimony during previous stages of the trial, as the judge is now instructing the jury to continue their deliberations and reminding them of the advice and direction given earlier in the trial.
