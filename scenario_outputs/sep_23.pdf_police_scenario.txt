PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
As an expert legal assistant, I've reviewed the provided context. Since there is no actual evidence presented in this document, I must infer that the question is referring to the overall narrative or scenario being portrayed by the police.

To answer the question, I would need more information about the specific case and the details surrounding it. However, based on the given context, we can see that the court has adjourned until Wednesday, suggesting that there may be further evidence or testimony to be presented.

If you're referring to potential evidence supporting the police's version of events, some possible examples could include:

1. Eyewitness accounts from witnesses who claim to have seen the incident unfold.
2. Physical evidence such as security footage, surveillance cameras, or physical objects found at the scene that support the police's narrative.
3. Statements from other individuals involved in the incident, including potential victims or suspects.
4. Forensic analysis of DNA, fingerprints, or other trace evidence that links to the alleged perpetrator.

Without more context, it is challenging to provide a more specific answer. If you could provide additional information about the case, I'd be happy to help further.
