2. He was unarmed and in plain clothes that day.
3. He made three witness statements about the events of July 22, 2005, including a first statement just days after the incident, a second substantial statement, and a third statement regarding telephone calls.

5. He arrived at New Scotland Yard around 7:00 am on July 22, 2005.
6. The police were not working formal shifts due to the extraordinary situation following the 7/7 bombings.
