PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the provided transcript, the evidence that supports the police's version of events is:

1. The statement from Detective Chief Inspector Southworth (read out by Sir Michael Wright) which reveals that he had previously understood that the DVLA point of contact was only accessible during office hours. However, after speaking with DC Martin Edwards and reading his witness statement, DCI Southworth accepts that his understanding was erroneous.

2. The statement from Detective Constable Martin Edwards (also read out by Sir Michael Wright) which confirms that he is one of two DVLA liaison officers and that any enquiries made to the DVLA have to be made through him or the other officer. This contradicts DCI Southworth's previous understanding, supporting the police's version of events.

These statements provide evidence that undermines DCI Southworth's original claim that the DVLA point of contact was not accessible outside office hours.
