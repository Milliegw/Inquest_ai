PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
The statement from Quincy Oji, a train driver, provides eyewitness account of the shooting incident at Stockwell tube station on July 22, 2005. The key points relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. The train was stopped at Stockwell tube station due to Kennington tube station being closed.
2. Oji heard people screaming and saw feet stamping (people running) before hearing gunshots (about 15 shots).
3. On the monitor, he saw lots of people in plain clothes with guns outside the carriage, including one man shooting directly into the carriage.
4. Oji turned off the train, which switched off the monitor, but could still see people running out towards the exit.

These findings are relevant to the coroner's decision-making as they provide a firsthand account of the events surrounding the shooting incident at Stockwell tube station, which will help inform their investigation and ultimately contribute to their decision.
