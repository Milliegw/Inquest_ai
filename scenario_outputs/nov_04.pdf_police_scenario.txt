PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the statement read in court, the evidence that supports the police's version of events is Quincy Oji's testimony about the shooting incident he witnessed while driving the tube train. Specifically:

1. He heard people screaming and saw people running towards the front of the train and stairs for the exit.
2. He saw multiple individuals with guns outside the carriage, including one person with a large gun shooting directly into the carriage.
3. The shooter's aim was straight, not up or down.

This evidence suggests that a group of individuals in plain clothes were involved in a shooting incident at Stockwell tube station on July 22, 2005. This supports the police's version of events and could potentially corroborate their findings.
