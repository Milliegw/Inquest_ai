PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. The importance of human judgment in decision-making: The witness, Chief Superintendent William Tillbrook, emphasized that while technology and training can be helpful, it is ultimately human judgment that must be relied upon.
2. The need for context and information in decision-making: The witness highlighted the importance of considering factors such as training, experience, and information in making decisions.
3. The role of debriefing and assessment in minimizing risks: The witness mentioned that debriefing and examining operations can help identify areas where protocols or safeguards can be put in place to minimize the risk of wrongful shootings.
4. The need for training on perceptual distortion: The witness noted that training on perceptual distortion, which is a human reaction that can occur during times of trauma, is important for specialized firearms officers.

These findings suggest that the coroner should consider the importance of human judgment, context, and information in making decisions about police operations and minimize risks by implementing protocols and safeguards.
