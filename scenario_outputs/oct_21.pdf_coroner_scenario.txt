PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the provided transcript, there are no findings that are directly relevant to the coroner's decision-making. The discussion appears to be about timetabling arrangements for a court case, and then shifts to a witness named James being questioned by Mr. Hough.

However, if you're asking me to summarize the main points from the witness testimony, here are some key findings:

* James and his team were tracking the suspect, Nettle Tip, in their car.
* They had picked up Lawrence at the side of the road and were planning to drop him off so he could get on a bus.
* A telephone call was received from Pat, the surveillance monitor, asking for a percentage level of certainty about the identity of the subject being followed.
* James expressed surprise and skepticism about this request, saying it was not something he had ever come across before.
* Despite his initial reaction, James agreed to ask other team members for their opinions on the matter.

These findings are relevant to the witness's testimony in a court case, but they do not have any direct bearing on the coroner's decision-making.
