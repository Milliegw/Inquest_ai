PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
As an expert legal assistant, I've reviewed the transcript and extracted relevant information. Based on Sir Michael Wright's directions, we can identify the key points that support the police's version of events:

1. The inquisition questionnaire has been carefully formulated to ensure that the jury only considers evidence presented during the trial.
2. The Coroner emphasizes that the jury must stick to the questionnaire and not consider other factors not listed.

While there may be some subtle hints at evidence supporting the police's version, it's essential to note that Sir Michael Wright's primary focus is on guiding the jury through the process and ensuring they follow the rules of the inquest. He doesn't explicitly provide specific evidence or details about the police's account of events.

To better understand the evidence supporting the police's version, we would need to review the testimony presented during the trial. If you'd like me to summarize any specific parts of the transcript related to this topic, please let me know!
