PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, here are the main findings that may be relevant to the coroner's decision-making:

1. The witness, "Derek", arrived at the scene around 6 am and quickly established the location of bus stops in the vicinity.
2. He identified a potential holding area at the TA Centre and a communal door for 21 Scotia Street.
3. By 6:20 am, he had also located a car of interest parked near the communal door.
4. All this information was relayed back to the operations room before 7 am.
5. The witness's primary concern was ensuring that a subject or suspect did not get on public transport, given the events of the previous day and July 7th.

These findings suggest that the witness was actively engaged in surveillance and gathering information about the area, with a focus on preventing potential threats from escaping or spreading through public transportation.
