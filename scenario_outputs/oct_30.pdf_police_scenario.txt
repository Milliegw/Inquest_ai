PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on this transcript, the evidence supporting the police's version of events is the witness statement made by Ralph Livock on July 22, 2005, which he has with him during his testimony. He mentions that there were certainly seats available on the train when they got on, and he recalls a man sitting in the seat now shown as free (seat before the double doors) who had a laptop bag.
