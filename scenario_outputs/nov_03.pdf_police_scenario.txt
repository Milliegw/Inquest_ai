PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, Anna Dunwoodie's testimony provides some evidence that supports the police's version of events. Specifically:

1. Her initial account to the police (day of the incident) was not thoroughly reviewed or revised by her.
2. She initially did not correct any inaccuracies in her initial statement.

This suggests that the police may have been relying on Anna's initial account, which would support their version of events. However, it is important to note that Anna later reviewed and revised her account, which revealed some inaccuracies, and this revised account is what is being referred to during the trial.

It appears that Anna's testimony is not necessarily supporting the police's version of events in its entirety, but rather providing context about how her initial account was taken.
