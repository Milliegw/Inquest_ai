PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. The witness (Sir Michael Wright) saw a male wearing a denim jacket and black baseball cap, later identified as Ivor, standing with his back to the glass partition in the carriage.
2. Ivor was olive-skinned and matched the description of the suspect they were following.
3. At the time, the witness was focusing on identifying the threat on the carriage and was trying to establish if Ivor was the subject.

These findings suggest that Sir Michael Wright saw Ivor standing near the glass partition in the carriage, which could be relevant to the coroner's investigation into the events surrounding CODENAME "C5".
