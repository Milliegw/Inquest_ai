PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
As a legal assistant, I can help you analyze the context and provide insights on the question.

The question asks what evidence supports the police's version of events. In the context of the Jean Charles de Menezes inquest, this question likely refers to the events surrounding his death during a botched anti-terrorist operation by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) on July 22, 2005.

To answer this question, we need to examine the evidence presented during the inquest. Some key pieces of evidence that may support the police's version of events include:

1. Witness testimony: Statements from police officers and other witnesses who were present at the scene or involved in the operation, such as C2 and C12.
2. CCTV footage: Footage captured by cameras near the King's Cross Station where de Menezes was killed, which shows his movements and interactions with the police before he was shot.
3. Forensic evidence: Physical evidence collected from the scene, such as bullet casings, shell fragments, or DNA samples, that could support or contradict the police's account of events.
4. Police reports and logs: Official records kept by the MPS about the operation, including details on the tactics used, communications, and decision-making processes.

It is essential to consider these pieces of evidence in conjunction with each other, as well as any inconsistencies or contradictions that may have arisen during the inquest.
