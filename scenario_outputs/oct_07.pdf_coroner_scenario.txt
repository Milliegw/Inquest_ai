PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, here are the main findings that may be relevant to the coroner's decision-making:

1. Sir Michael Wright recalled that JC (John Cremin) got back onto the number 2 bus at the same stop where it had stopped earlier, contradicting the surveillance log which stated that he caught the bus at a stop further down the road.
2. The coroner's log from Mr. Cremin's notes mentions an entry "Followed [arrow] surveillance into station, entered tube, sat inside, confronted by SO19 team, shot in head, non-compliant" with a note "from SO19". This suggests that the information may have come from the SO19 team.
3. The coroner noted the presence of small numbers 197 and 39 on the log page, which may be relevant to understanding the events that unfolded.
4. The coroner's notes also mentioned an entry "SO19 black team, could there have been any confusion re: Kratos -- VE 'no'" which seems to refer to a question asked by Mr. Boutcher to Vince about potential confusion regarding Kratos, and the answer being "no".

These findings may be relevant to the coroner's decision-making in determining the cause and circumstances of John Cremin's death.
