PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative?

RESPONSE:
As a legal assistant, I'd suggest focusing on the following key areas to challenge the police narrative:

1. **Inconsistencies in notes and records**: Mr. Hilliard mentioned that Alan's notes from 2004 relate to an inquiry about Portnall Road at that time. This could be a significant inconsistency in the police's account, which would require further investigation.
2. **Lack of dating for 2005 incident in 2004**: The fact that Alan didn't date his notes for a 2005 incident in 2004 raises questions about potential tampering or manipulation of evidence.
3. **Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dick's background and experience**: By examining her background, experience, and past assignments (e.g., time at Bramshill Police Staff College), we could identify potential biases or conflicts that might have influenced her perspective on the case.
4. **Potential misrepresentations in testimony**: As a Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Cressida Dick's testimony would carry significant weight. Carefully scrutinizing her statements and questioning any inconsistencies or perceived omissions could help uncover potential misrepresentations.
5. **Alternative explanations for events**: By considering alternative scenarios and theories, we might identify gaps or weaknesses in the police narrative that could be exploited to challenge their account.

To effectively challenge the police narrative, I would:

1. Conduct a thorough review of all available evidence, including notes, records, and witness statements.
2. Identify potential inconsistencies and areas of confusion, focusing on those most critical to the case.
3. Prepare thoughtful questions for witnesses, including Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dick, to clarify any ambiguities or unclear points.
4. Consider alternative explanations for events and identify potential weaknesses in the police's account.

By taking a meticulous and strategic approach, I believe we can effectively challenge the police narrative and uncover new information that might shed light on the case.
