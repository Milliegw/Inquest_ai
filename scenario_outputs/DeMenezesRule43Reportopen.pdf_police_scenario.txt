PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
The evidence supporting the police's version of events is not explicitly stated in the Rule 43 Report. The report primarily focuses on identifying concerns with Metropolitan Police systems and practices that may have contributed to the risk of other deaths occurring or continuing in the future.

However, it can be inferred that the police's version of events is supported by their own evidence presented during the inquest, which included statements from officers involved in the operation. The report does not specifically address the police's account of Jean-Charles de Menezes' death, but rather focuses on systemic issues and practices that may have contributed to the event.

It is also possible that other reports or documents provided by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) to the coroner's office were reviewed during the inquest, which could have supported the police's version of events. However, these specific documents are not included in the Rule 43 Report.
