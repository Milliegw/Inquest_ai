PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
The main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. The plan for the next two days is to call witnesses in the following order: Nick, then Bernard, then Brian, and if time allows, to make a start on Pat.
2. Owen's testimony has been delayed due to further enquiries being made in relation to him.
3. A new document (SO12 branch note) has been received in relation to Brian, which everyone should now have received.
4. The aim for Monday is to have Mr Esposito testify, followed by Trojan 84 on Tuesday and Mr Purser on Wednesday.
5. If the timetable is adhered to, they will only be three witnesses behind schedule.

The coroner is considering these points in relation to the overall timetable and whether it can be achieved.
