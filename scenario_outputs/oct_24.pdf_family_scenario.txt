PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative?

RESPONSE:
As a legal assistant, my primary goal is to provide objective information and analysis based on the provided transcript. Since I am not directly involved in this case, my role is limited to analyzing the evidence presented during the witness testimony.

To challenge the police narrative as if representing the family, I would focus on the following key points:

1. **Contrast between "exceptional hours" and normal working procedures**: The witness mentions working exceptional hours, which could imply a level of urgency or chaos. This might raise questions about whether normal procedures were followed during the investigation.
2. **Lack of formal shifts**: The witness explains that they weren't on formal shifts after 7 July. This could be seen as an attempt to avoid accountability for any actions taken without proper supervision or oversight.
3. **Unspecified arrival time at New Scotland Yard**: The witness can't pinpoint their exact arrival time, which might suggest a lack of transparency about their involvement in the investigation from early on.
4. **Previous involvement in investigations (Warren Street arrest)**: The witness had been involved in an earlier investigation, which could raise questions about potential biases or influence on their actions during this incident.
5. **Potential for contamination**: The witness mentions taking precautions against cross-contamination due to their previous experience at Edgware Road tunnels. This might suggest that there was a risk of compromising evidence or contaminating the crime scene.

As representing the family, I would emphasize these points to challenge the police narrative and potentially raise questions about the thoroughness and integrity of the investigation.
