PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
There are no main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making in this transcript, as it appears to be a procedural update and not a part of the actual trial or investigation. The transcript discusses the jury's deliberations, their potential need for additional time to reach a verdict, and arrangements for continuing the trial at Southwark Crown Court if necessary. There is no discussion of evidence, witness testimony, or any other findings that would be relevant to a coroner's decision-making.
