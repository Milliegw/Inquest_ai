PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the provided transcript, there are no specific findings or evidence presented that would be relevant to a coroner's decision-making. The proceeding appears to be related to a jury deliberation and verdict in a criminal case.

However, if I had to summarize the main points from the transcript, it would be:

1. The judge (SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT) informs the jury that they can accept majority decisions of 10-0, 9-1, or 8-2.
2. The judge emphasizes that there is no pressure on the jury and encourages them to take as long as needed to reach a decision.
3. The jury retires to deliberate at 10:12 am and continues until 4:30 pm, with a short adjournment.
4. The judge asks the foreman of the jury if starting earlier the next day would be helpful, and the foreman agrees it might make a difference.

It's important to note that this transcript does not provide any specific evidence or findings that would be relevant to a coroner's decision-making.
