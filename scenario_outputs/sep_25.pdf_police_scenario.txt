PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, it appears that the police's strategy to control the premises at Scotia Road through covert surveillance and following individuals until it was safe to challenge them is supported by evidence recorded in Assistant Commissioner John McDowall's red book. Specifically:

1. The typed copy page numbers (page 1858) show that the strategy was documented under the "DEC" sections, with the specific entry being: "Gold firearms strategy in respect of premises."
2. This documentation provides a record of the police's plan to control the premises and follow individuals until it was safe to challenge them.
3. The testimony from Assistant Commissioner McDowall confirms that he set this strategy after identifying Scotia Road as a possible address for Hussain Osman, one of the attempted bombers.
4. The evidence also suggests that the police had found a rucksack with correspondence relating to a job seeker application or correspondence, which may have been relevant to their investigation.

It's worth noting that while this transcript provides some insight into the police's version of events, it is only a small part of the overall evidence presented during the trial.
