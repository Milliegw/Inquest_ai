PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative?

RESPONSE:
As a legal assistant, I'd focus on the evidence provided by Commander Stewart's statement. Since Mr. Hilliard has already raised concerns about the Metropolitan Police response, it seems likely that there are discrepancies or questions surrounding their handling of the events.

To challenge the police narrative, I would concentrate on the following lines of inquiry:

1. The timeline of events: If there are inconsistencies in the timing of the events, I would seek to clarify these through additional evidence and witness testimony.
2. Police procedures: I would examine whether the police followed proper protocols and procedures during their response to the events. Were there any deviations from standard operating procedures?
3. Witness statements: Are there any witness accounts that contradict or cast doubt on the police narrative? Have witnesses been properly interviewed, and are their statements consistent with each other?
4. Forensic evidence: Is there any forensic evidence (e.g., surveillance footage, DNA, physical evidence) that challenges the police's account of what happened?
5. Corroboration: Are there any independent sources or corroborating accounts that support the family's version of events and contradict the police narrative?

By focusing on these areas, I would aim to highlight potential inconsistencies in the police's account, which could then be used to challenge their narrative and advocate for a more comprehensive understanding of what transpired.
