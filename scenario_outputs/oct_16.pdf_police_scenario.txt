PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the provided transcript, there is no direct evidence presented to support the police's version of events. However, we can infer some points from the testimony:

1. The officer in charge was supposed to have control over the location, including surveillance and firearms.
2. A reconnaissance of the area was necessary to determine the feasibility of stopping a suspect without compromising the covert operation or allowing them to escape by public transport.
3. It was intended that someone would provide proximity and sort out the area to ensure a rough idea of what's possible.

These points suggest that the police had a plan in place to handle the situation, but it is unclear if this plan was actually followed or if there were any deviations from the original strategy. The testimony does not explicitly support the police's version of events, and further evidence would be needed to confirm their account.
