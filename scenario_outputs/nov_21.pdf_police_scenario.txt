PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
There is no specific mention of evidence supporting the police's version of events in this transcript. The discussion appears to focus on legal submissions and the judge's concerns about directing a jury to return a verdict on whether the shots were justified, rather than presenting any new evidence. It seems that the previous discussions may have already presented the evidence relevant to the case, but it is not detailed in this specific transcript.
