PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, the main piece of evidence supporting the police's version of events is the witness statement made by Alpha 1 (the officer) on July 22, 2005. This statement was later typed out and became part of the record.

Additionally, the witness statement made by Alpha 1 on October 22, 2008, also provides relevant information about the events surrounding the operation. The typed copies of these statements are being referred to during the questioning, which suggests that they will be used as evidence in the proceedings.

It's worth noting that the transcript does not mention any specific physical evidence or witness testimony from other individuals, but rather focuses on Alpha 1's account of the events.
