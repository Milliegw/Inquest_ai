PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the context provided, the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. The officer, Ivor, was concerned that Jean Charles de Menezes might be carrying weapons or a device and wrapped his arms around him to prevent any potential detonation.
2. Ivor stated that he was attempting to stop De Menezes from moving his hands or accessing any weapons he may have had.
3. When the CO19 firearms officers arrived, Ivor described De Menezes as advancing quickly towards them, moving forward about 2-3 feet before being stopped by Ivor's grasp.
4. At no point prior to this stage did Ivor observe anything that suggested De Menezes was a suicide bomber about to detonate a bomb.

These findings are relevant to the coroner's decision-making as they provide insight into the events surrounding De Menezes' shooting and whether it was a justifiable use of force. The coroner will likely consider these factors in determining the cause and circumstances of De Menezes' death, as well as any potential wrongdoing or liability on the part of the officers involved.
