PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. The witness, known as "Harry" (codename), was a surveillance officer in SO12 Special Branch and was part of the grey surveillance team on July 22.
2. Harry made three statements about the events that day, with the first one written just after the incident on July 23.
3. He also gave evidence at the Health and Safety trial on October 12, 2007.
4. On July 22, Harry was part of a team called to attend a briefing at New Scotland Yard, which was given by Mr. Whiddett and an officer referred to as Colin.
5. During this briefing, Harry was told about several suspects and shown photographs, including one that can be displayed on screen (tab 37 of the jury bundle).
6. At the end of the briefing, Harry asked for clarification on what "contain" meant in terms of surveillance, specifically asking about containing premises or suspects.

These findings appear to be relevant to the coroner's decision-making as they provide insight into Harry's role and actions on July 22, which may have implications for the investigation being conducted.
