PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on this transcript, I did not find any specific mention of evidence supporting the police's version of events. However, Sir Michael Wright is more focused on summarizing the evidence and directing the jury on the law rather than presenting a defense of the police's actions.

It appears that the focus is on reminding the jury to consider all the evidence presented during the inquest and not just rely on his summary or opinion. He emphasizes the importance of the jury's decision-making role and encourages them to carefully consider the facts, including the transcript of the 36 days of evidence they have heard.
