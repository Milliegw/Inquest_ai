PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the provided transcript, there is no specific evidence mentioned that directly supports the police's version of events. The conversation primarily focuses on logistical matters related to jury selection and the court setup.

However, it can be inferred that the evidence presented during the trial will likely support the police's version of events, as Mr. Hilliard (the legal assistant) does not mention any specific challenges or concerns with the prosecution's case. It is also possible that the "photographs" mentioned in the transcript are part of the evidence to be presented, but without further context, it is difficult to determine their relevance to the police's version of events.

To better understand the evidence supporting the police's version of events, additional context or information from other parts of the trial would be necessary.
