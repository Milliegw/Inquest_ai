PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on this transcript, there is no direct evidence presented that specifically supports the police's version of events. The discussion revolves around the concerns raised by Mr. Stern regarding certain points made by Sir Michael Wright during questioning of Andrew. It appears that the focus is on clarifying factual inaccuracies and ensuring that the inquest proceeds fairly.

However, it can be inferred that the police's version of events may have been influenced by the testimony provided by senior police officers, including C2 and C12, who were involved in the planning and execution of the operation. Their accounts would likely play a significant role in shaping the police's narrative of what transpired.

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the evidence supporting the police's version of events, I would recommend reviewing the transcript further or accessing additional materials to learn about the testimony provided by these officers, as well as any other relevant evidence presented during the inquest.
