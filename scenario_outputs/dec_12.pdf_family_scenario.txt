PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative?

RESPONSE:
As a legal assistant, my role is not to provide specific evidence or make arguments on behalf of a party. However, based on the context provided, it appears that the family's representatives (Mr. Hough and others) are advocating for abandoning question 4(a) if the jury cannot reach an agreement, citing Lord Bingham's approach in the Middleton case.

If I were representing the family, my focus would be on highlighting the inconsistencies or weaknesses in the police narrative that might have led to the impasse. Here are some potential areas of inquiry:

1. Investigative gaps: Are there any gaps in the investigation that could have contributed to the jury's inability to reach a consensus? Were certain aspects of the case not thoroughly examined?
2. Witness credibility: Which witnesses were interviewed by the police, and what was their testimony regarding question 4(a)? Are there any inconsistencies or contradictions among the witnesses' accounts that might be relevant to the impasse?
3. Physical evidence: What physical evidence was collected at the scene or during the investigation? Is there a possibility that some crucial piece of evidence was overlooked or not properly analyzed?
4. Timeline discrepancies: Are there any discrepancies in the timeline provided by the police regarding the events surrounding question 4(a)? Can these inconsistencies be reconciled, or do they suggest that the jury's impasse is justified?
5. Alternative explanations: Are there alternative explanations for what happened during question 4(a) that have not been adequately explored? Has the police investigation considered all plausible scenarios, or are there potential avenues of inquiry that remain unexplored?

By focusing on these areas, I would aim to challenge the police narrative and demonstrate that the impasse is reasonable given the complexity and uncertainty surrounding question 4(a).
