PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, it appears that Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick has just begun her testimony. As a result, there is no specific evidence presented yet to support the police's version of events. However, Mr. Hilliard is likely to present documents and other evidence in due course as part of his questioning.

In general, law enforcement agencies typically rely on various types of evidence to build their case, including:

1. Witness statements: Statements from individuals who claim to have witnessed the event or have relevant information.
2. Physical evidence: Items such as DNA samples, fingerprints, security footage, and physical objects that can be linked to the alleged crime.
3. Documentary evidence: Documents such as police reports, witness statements, medical records, and other written records that support their version of events.
4. Forensic analysis: Scientific tests and analysis of physical evidence, such as DNA or fingerprint comparisons.

As the questioning progresses, it's likely that Mr. Hilliard will present some of this evidence to support the police's version of events.
