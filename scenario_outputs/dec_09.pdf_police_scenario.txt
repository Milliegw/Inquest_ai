PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, it appears that Sir Michael Wright's directions and guidance are intended to help the jury make decisions about the case. There is no specific evidence presented by the police or other parties that would support their version of events.

However, some points made by Sir Michael Wright during his directions might be interpreted as supporting the police's version of events:

1. He emphasizes the difficulty in providing an identification of the man under surveillance (Mr. de Menezes) due to the limited time available and the circumstances of the surveillance.
2. He reminds the jury that Mr. de Menezes was not continuously observed during the half-hour or so he was under surveillance, which might imply that the police did not have a clear view of him at all times.

These points could be seen as supporting the police's version of events by suggesting that it was reasonable for them to struggle with identifying Mr. de Menezes and that their observations were likely affected by the circumstances of the surveillance. However, without further evidence or testimony from the police or other witnesses, it is difficult to say definitively what evidence supports the police's version of events.
