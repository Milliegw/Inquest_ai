PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, there are no significant findings or evidence presented that would directly impact the Coroner's decision-making. The discussion appears to be focused on procedural matters and background information about the witness, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick.

However, one point of interest is the mention of Alan's notes (page 375) which were written in March 2004, possibly related to an inquiry concerning Portnall Road at that time. This could potentially be relevant to the Coroner's investigation, but further information would be needed to determine its significance.

Overall, this transcript does not provide any conclusive findings or evidence that would significantly influence the Coroner's decision-making.
