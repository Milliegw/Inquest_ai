PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on this transcript, it appears that the police's version of events is not specifically mentioned. The conversation focuses on procedural matters such as orders to prevent publication of certain information, managing juror availability, and handling juror replacements.

However, if we assume that Commander Stewart provided a thorough statement about the Metropolitan Police response to these events (as mentioned in point 2), it's possible that this statement may contain evidence supporting the police's version of events.
