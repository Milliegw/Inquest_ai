PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, Steve Swain is a witness who is testifying about his involvement and knowledge regarding the events that transpired. As a retired Chief Superintendent from the Metropolitan Police, he was centrally involved in developing police strategies and tactics for dealing with suicide terrorists.

Swain's evidence is not specifically focused on supporting or contradicting the police's version of events. Instead, it appears to be more general in nature, discussing his background, experience, and involvement in the development of police policies and strategies related to suicide terrorism.

It's possible that Swain's testimony may touch upon specific events or incidents, but based on this transcript alone, there doesn't seem to be any direct evidence presented that specifically supports or contradicts the police's version of events.
