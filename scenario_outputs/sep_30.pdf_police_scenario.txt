PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, some evidence that supports the police's version of events includes:

1. Detective Chief Inspector Michael Forteath's testimony about his role as loggist and his notes from meetings involving senior officers, including Mr. McDowall.
2. The existence of a typewritten log that records key decisions and events, which is being presented to the jury.
3. The appointment of Detective Superintendent McKenna as Senior Investigating Officer for the investigation into the bombings.
4. The appointment of Mr. Boutcher as Senior Investigating Officer for the manhunt.

These pieces of evidence suggest that the police had a structured approach to their investigation and were working together effectively to respond to the attempted bombings.
