PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the provided transcript, it appears that "Bernard" (a police officer) is being questioned as a witness in an inquiry related to a specific event or series of events. The evidence supporting the police's version of events is not explicitly stated in this transcript.

However, we can infer some information about the investigation and potential evidence:

1. SO12 branch notes: A document was received today (October 9th, 2008) regarding Brian, which everyone should have received.
2. Surveillance officers' testimony: The police plan to call seven surveillance officers who were originally scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, indicating that their testimony is relevant to the investigation.
3. Witness statements: Bernard, Nick, Brian, Pat, Mr. Esposito, Trojan 84, and Mr. Purser are all expected to testify in the inquiry, suggesting that each witness has information or evidence related to the police's version of events.

To determine the specific evidence supporting the police's version of events, further investigation would be necessary to review the statements made by these witnesses, as well as any other relevant evidence presented during the inquiry.
