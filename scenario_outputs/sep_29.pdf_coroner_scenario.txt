PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. The command structure diagram provided to the jury is a simplified version and may be updated later with more complex information.
2. The diagram shows the Gold, Silver, and Bronze commanders, with Mr. McDowall, Commander Dick, and Mr. Boutcher identified as key figures.
3. The Scotia Road and Portnall Road addresses are specific operations that were discussed during the inquest.
4. The Silver Commander was on the ground for each of these operations, while the Bronzes (team leaders) were not specified.
5. Officer Ralph is mentioned as a Bronze commander for the firearms teams.

These findings provide context for the evidence presented by Andrew and will inform the coroner's decision-making process.
