PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the evidence presented during the inquest and further materials provided by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), the coroner identifies several points of concern regarding systemic failures that occurred in July 2005. These concerns may pose a risk of future deaths or continuation of circumstances that could lead to such risks.

The main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. The jury's conclusions suggesting systemic failures.
2. The MPS's handling of anti-terrorist operations, particularly with regards to the identification and verification of suspects.
3. Inadequate communication and information sharing between police officers and teams.
4. Lack of clear protocols for dealing with suspected terrorists.
5. Failure to adequately review and update procedures in response to changing circumstances.

These findings will inform the coroner's decision on whether to make a Rule 43 report, which would call for the MPS to review and revise their practices to prevent future occurrences of similar systemic failures.
