PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, the key evidence that supports the police's version of events is Ivor's testimony about his observations and actions during the incident.

Specifically:

1. Ivor described wrapping his arms around Mr. de Menezes to prevent him from accessing weapons or detonating a device.
2. He stated that he was attempting to stop Mr. de Menezes from moving his hands, implying that he believed Mr. de Menezes might be carrying a weapon or device.
3. Ivor described Mr. de Menezes standing up and moving forward towards him and the firearms officers, stating that this was done in a "fast walk" or about 2-3 steps.
4. He testified that he was only 3-4 feet away from Mr. de Menezes when he grabbed him, which means that Mr. de Menezes could have taken only 2-3 steps to get to him.

These statements support the police's version of events that they believed Mr. de Menezes might be carrying a weapon or device and acted accordingly by attempting to subdue him.

It is worth noting that Ivor's testimony may not necessarily be considered objective evidence, as it is based on his own perceptions and interpretations of the situation. However, it does provide an important perspective on what happened during the incident.
