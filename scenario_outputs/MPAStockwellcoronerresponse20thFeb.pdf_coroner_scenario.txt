PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
The main findings relevant to the Coroner's decision-making are:

1. The Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) acknowledges that progress has been slower than desired in addressing some of the recommendations made by the MPA following the scrutiny into the Stockwell shooting.
2. The MPA confirms that changes have been made to the command structure, including the removal of the term "Designated Senior Officer" (DSO), but progress is slow and it's important to ensure national arrangements don't conflict with local ones.
3. The MPA acknowledges that the Gold/Silver/Bronze structure remains the most appropriate command and control structure for policing operations, but notes that new guidelines on command and control are being tested, and a cadre of ACPO officers is being trained to deal with situations where extreme threat is present.

These findings may be relevant to the Coroner's decision-making in considering the events surrounding Jean Charles de Menezes' death. They suggest that while progress has been made in addressing some of the recommendations, there are still issues related to command structure and decision-making that need to be addressed to minimize the likelihood of similar tragedies occurring again in the future.
