PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
There is no evidence presented in this transcript that specifically supports the police's version of events. This transcript appears to be a record of procedural matters, such as jury deliberations and court adjournments, rather than presenting any specific evidence. If you're looking for information on the case itself, I'd need more context or additional documents to provide any insights.
