PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on this transcript, it appears that there are no specific pieces of evidence mentioned that directly support the police's version of events regarding Jean Charles de Menezes' death. The discussion focuses on corrections to Sir Michael Wright's previous summing-up and introducing new information.

However, some points can be inferred as potentially supporting the police's version:

1. Charlie 2 and Charlie 12's description of Jean Charles' jacket appearing bulky: This could suggest that the officers had a legitimate reason to suspect Jean Charles was wearing bulky clothing that could conceal a bomb.
2. Mr Stern's argument that the officers made a split-second assessment in good faith: If the jury accepts this, it might support the police's claim that they acted on a genuine belief about Jean Charles' intentions.

Please note that these points are speculative and not explicitly presented as evidence. The transcript primarily deals with corrections to Sir Michael Wright's previous summing-up and setting the stage for further discussion.
