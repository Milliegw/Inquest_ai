PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, it appears that the police's version of events is supported by Sir Michael Wright's investigation into the incident at the Oval gates. He states that "having made enquiries about the circumstances of yesterday's incident... I have come to the conclusion that I need take no further steps in respect of that individual" (lines 20-22). This suggests that his investigation found that the photographer was indeed attempting to take a photograph of an anonymised witness or witnesses, but that he did not intend to breach the court's order protecting their anonymity.

Sir Michael Wright also notes that the police will be taking steps to prevent similar incidents in the future, including installing barriers around the witness entrance gate (lines 6-12). This supports the police's version of events and suggests that they are taking proactive measures to ensure the anonymity of witnesses is protected.

Overall, while there may have been some minor discrepancies or misunderstandings, the evidence presented in this transcript does not suggest any significant contradictions between the police's version of events and other accounts.
