PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the transcript, the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. The possibility of a juror leaving the country after December 10th (Wednesday), which would require an order under section 4.2 of the Contempt of Court Act to prevent publication of submissions and rulings until the jury returns their verdict.
2. The coroner's inclination is to ask the juror to remain at least until the end of his commitment, rather than losing a juror if possible.
3. Commander Stewart has provided a thorough statement about the Metropolitan Police response to certain events, which may be relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

These findings suggest that the coroner needs to consider making an order under section 4.2 of the Contempt of Court Act to prevent publication of sensitive information until the jury returns their verdict, and also needs to take into account the potential impact of a juror leaving the country on the ongoing trial.
