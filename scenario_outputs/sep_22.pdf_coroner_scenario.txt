PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the provided transcript, the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. The proposal to remove the anonymous witness corridor and screen off the back of the court when anonymous witnesses give evidence, which would increase available space in the courtroom.
2. Three amendments were made to the jury bundle:
   a. Tab 38, page 50: A sheet containing side-by-side photographs was removed from the bundle.
   b. Divider 2, page 9 (bottom right): The entry "Geoff. Followed bus from Brixton to Stockwell" was corrected to reflect the correct direction of travel.
   c. Under H3, "Ivor", the last sentence now reads: "Holding JC when C2 and C12 fired shots".

These findings are relevant to the coroner's decision-making as they relate to the logistics and procedures for conducting the trial, including jury selection and witness testimony.
