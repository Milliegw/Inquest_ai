PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the Metropolitan Police Commissioner's response to the Rule 43 Report, the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

* The Coroner is concerned about the unclear command structure and the role of the Gold Commander after setting the strategy.
* The Coroner suggests that the MPS might usefully review the command structure and the ACPO Manual of the Police Use of Firearms to provide further clarification on the continuing role played by the Gold Commander.

The Commissioner's response acknowledges these concerns and states that the MPS is contributing to a revised ACPO Manual of Guidance on the Management, Command, and Deployment of Armed Officers (ACPO Manual 2009) to address this issue.
