PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the testimony of Detective Chief Inspector Michael Forteath, the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. Forteath was working as a loggist for Mr. McDowall in July 2005 and was involved in logging decisions and notes.
2. On July 21, 2005, Forteath became aware of the attempted bombings and went to the SO13 reserve area at New Scotland Yard.
3. He was asked by Mr. White to act as a loggist in relation to the new attempted attacks.
4. The coroner's attention is drawn to the meeting involving Mr. McDowall, Mr. Boutcher, and others on July 21, 2005, at 2:22 PM, which included discussions about the investigation into the bombings.
5. Detective Superintendent McKenna was appointed as Senior Investigating Officer for the investigation into the bombings.

These findings are relevant to the coroner's decision-making because they provide information about the context and events surrounding the attempted bombings on July 21, 2005. The coroner may consider this evidence when making a determination about the circumstances of the event and whether it was a terrorist attack or not.
