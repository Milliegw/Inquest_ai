PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on the provided context, the police's version of events is that they believed Jean Charles de Menezes was likely to be the suspect, Hussain Osman, and that he was using anti-surveillance techniques. This belief led them to form a view that he was a threat and directed a team of specialist firearms officers to stop him.

The evidence supporting this version of events includes:

* The surveillance officers' observations of de Menezes' behavior, which they believed raised concerns about his intentions (Paragraph 4)
* Commander Dick's orders and instructions to the officers involved in the operation (Paragraphs 3-5)

It is worth noting that the police's version of events has been disputed by other evidence and arguments presented during the inquest.
