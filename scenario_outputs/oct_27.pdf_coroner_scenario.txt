PROMPT: Summarize the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making.

RESPONSE:
Based on the provided transcript, here are the main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making:

1. The officer arrived outside Stockwell station and parked his car in a central position using hatch markings as an indicator.
2. He had driven slowly down Clapham Road, turned off his blues and twos (lights and sirens), and hoped to take action if needed when arriving at the station.
3. When he first became aware of the bus, it was approaching diagonally or at an oblique angle from his perspective.
4. As they got closer to Stockwell tube station, he couldn't see the bus clearly.

These findings are relevant to the coroner's decision-making because they provide context about the officer's arrival at the scene and his initial observations of the bus before Jean Charles de Menezes was shot. The coroner will likely consider these details in determining the circumstances surrounding de Menezes' death and whether the police actions were justified or not.
