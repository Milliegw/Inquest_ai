PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative?

RESPONSE:
As a legal assistant representing the family, I would focus on the following evidence to challenge the police narrative:

1. Lack of transparency and accountability:
	* Documents showing inadequate training and preparation of officers involved in the incident.
	* Emails or memos revealing internal discussions about the shooting being a "good kill" or minimizing the significance of Jean's death.
	* Records indicating that the investigation was compromised by biased or incomplete reporting.
2. Inconsistencies and contradictions:
	* Testimony from officers contradicting each other on key details, such as the number of shots fired or the location of Jean at the time of shooting.
	* Physical evidence, like security camera footage, showing Jean's actions do not align with officer testimony.
3. Unanswered questions:
	* Why were there no CCTV cameras or surveillance in the area to capture the incident?
	* What was the exact timeline of events leading up to and during the shooting?
	* Were there any potential alternative scenarios that could have prevented the use of deadly force?
4. Officer performance and motivations:
	* Evidence of prior incidents where officers involved in the shooting had displayed similar reckless or aggressive behavior.
	* Statements from officers indicating they were motivated by factors other than a genuine threat to public safety, such as racism or bias.
5. Policy and procedure inconsistencies:
	* Documentation showing that MPS policies and procedures were not followed during the incident, or that there were contradictions between different policies.
	* Examples of similar incidents where police deviated from standard operating procedures without consequence.
6. Witness intimidation and manipulation:
	* Evidence suggesting that witnesses were intimidated or coerced into providing false testimony or not speaking out about the incident.
	* Records indicating that investigators manipulated witness statements or failed to properly record evidence.
7. Independent expert analysis:
	* Reports from forensic experts, medical professionals, or other independent analysts contradicting official findings and highlighting potential flaws in the investigation.

By focusing on these areas of concern, I would challenge the police narrative and argue that the shooting was not a justifiable use of deadly force.
