PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events?

RESPONSE:
Based on this transcript, it appears that Dr. Shorrocks' report from 2005 contains two significant errors in its description of Jean Charles de Menezes' death. These errors are:

1. De Menezes did not vault over the ticket barrier.
2. He did not run downstairs and onto a train, stumbling.

Dr. Shorrocks explains that he arrived at Stockwell tube station on July 22nd in a police car, where he was met by some of the officers who were involved in the incident. As such, his report likely reflects information provided to him by these officers, which is inconsistent with the true events that occurred.

It appears that Dr. Shorrocks' evidence supports the police's version of events, but with errors that are later corrected by the investigation.
