PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative?

RESPONSE:
As an expert legal assistant, I would focus on challenging the police narrative by highlighting inconsistencies, contradictions, and gaps in their story. Here are some key areas of investigation:

1. Frank's solo watch: The police claim that Frank was the only person keeping watch from the van outside Scotia Road. However, Mr. Perry seems to suggest that there might have been a backup or deputy, which raises questions about Frank's reliability as the sole observer.
2. Verification of occupants: The police relied on the voters' register to identify who was living in each flat, but this source may not be comprehensive or accurate. I would investigate alternative methods to verify occupancy, such as interviewing neighbors or reviewing property records.
3. Mr. Osman's registration: Sir Michael Wright mentions that Mr. Osman might not have been registered on the voters' register. This could be a crucial inconsistency in the police narrative, and I would delve deeper into this issue.
4. Red book entries: The introduction of the red book pages (divider 38) seems to imply that there are important details or inconsistencies within the police's own records. I would carefully review these entries to identify any discrepancies or potential evidence that challenges their account.

By focusing on these areas, I believe we can create a compelling narrative that raises doubts about the police's version of events and potentially highlights alternative explanations for what occurred.
