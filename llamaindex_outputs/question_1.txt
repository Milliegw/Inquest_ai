These notes were made on Skye computer at New Scotland Yard when the events were clear in my mind. They were produced on or around the early morning on 31 July to 3 August 2005. This information is from the document data... I do recall if these notes were supplied to Operation Erini on request but had they requested, they would have been. The original document no longer exists, having been overwritten by the modified version. (Source: oct_21.pdf.txt, paragraphs 10-11)
