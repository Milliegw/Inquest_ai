QUESTION: For each theme above, expand with all subpoints, criticisms, and recommendations, and include any relevant paragraph or page references if available.

RESPONSE:
**Theme 1:**

* The practice of witnesses conferring in the preparation of their accounts has been a concern for the Higher Courts.
* This is evident from recent years' repeated expressions of concern about this practice.
* The resulting investigation should comply with the procedural obligation inherent in Article 2 of the ECHR, which requires the state to secure the best evidence by a fair, independent, and transparent process. (Page reference: Not applicable)

**Theme 2:**

* The ACPO guidance recommends that officers should ordinarily give their accounts as soon as practicable and without conferring with each other.
* Statements should include details of any conferring which has taken place.
* This is to ensure the best evidence by a fair, independent, and transparent process. (Page reference: 44)

**Theme 3:**

* Allegations of dishonesty were made, which would have been impossible to make in the absence of collaboration.
* The reliability of witnesses' accounts was questioned due to the practice of conferring in their preparation.
* This has led to concerns about securing the best evidence by a fair, independent, and transparent process. (Page reference: 15)

**Theme 4:**

* The MPA issued a Report on December 4th, 2008, formally recognising that the ACPO guidance would be followed in fatal shooting investigations.
* The report mentioned the MPS's commissioning of a Gold group under DAC Hitchcock to develop further guidance and the Directorate of Professional Standards' development of a new post-incident procedure. (Page reference: 46)

**Theme 5:**

* Recommendations were made for clear guidance to be given to ensure that officers prepare early and independent accounts of any police actions which result in fatal or other serious injuries.
* Serious consideration was given to audio- and video-recording of post-incident debriefings. (Page reference: 46)
