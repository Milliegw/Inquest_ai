QUESTION: Extract and list, in as much detail as possible, every instance in the provided documents where police evidence, statements, or procedures are described as dishonest, unreliable, inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or otherwise questioned. For each instance, provide the relevant quote or passage from the documents, and specify the context (e.g., conferring on accounts, alteration of logs, communications failures, evidence handling, expert witness reliability, etc.). Organize your answer by theme (e.g., Conferring on Accounts, Surveillance Logs, Communications, Evidence Handling, Expert Witnesses, etc.), and use bullet points for clarity. Include both explicit allegations and any concerns, criticisms, or recommendations related to the reliability or accuracy of police evidence or procedures.

RESPONSE:
Here is the extracted list of instances where police evidence, statements, or procedures are described as dishonest, unreliable, inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or otherwise questioned:

**Conferring on Accounts**

• The IPCC raised concerns that the difference in treatment between police and civilian witnesses to this incident were not acceptable or justifiable. Members of the public were expected to be interviewed and make statements soon after witnessing a traumatic incident without being able to confer with other witnesses and provide a joint account, whereas police officers involved were allowed to return to their base, refresh themselves, and confer. (MPA Stockwell Scrutiny Report, paragraph 11)
• The IPCC expressed concerns regarding the post-incident procedures put in place after other incidents where police firearms are discharged, citing that officers involved in the incident wrote up their notes together, which makes those accounts less credible. (MPA Stockwell Scrutiny Report, paragraphs 12 and 13)

**Surveillance Logs**

• None found.

**Communications**

• The IPCC raised concerns about the practice of witnesses conferring in the preparation of their accounts. (DeMenezes Rule 43 Report, paragraph 45)
• Allegations were made that would have been impossible to make in the absence of collaboration. (DeMenezes Rule 43 Report, paragraph 15)

**Evidence Handling**

• The IPCC expressed concerns about the post-incident procedures put in place after other incidents where police firearms are discharged, citing that officers involved in the incident wrote up their notes together, which makes those accounts less credible. (MPA Stockwell Scrutiny Report, paragraphs 12 and 13)
• The IPCC recommended reviewing existing guidance and practice to ensure that appropriate and robust mechanisms exist to secure an accurate and auditable record of "hot" and team/group debriefs. (MPA Stockwell Scrutiny Report, paragraph 12)

**Expert Witnesses**

• None found.

**Other**

• The MPA's report formally recognised that the ACPO guidance would be followed in fatal shooting investigations, stating that there is an additional imperative to ensure a fair, independent, and transparent process. (DeMenezes Rule 43 Report, paragraphs 44-46)
• Sir Michael Wright recommended giving clear guidance to ensure that officers prepare early and independent accounts of any police actions which result in fatal or other serious injuries. He also suggested considering audio- and video-recording of post-incident debriefings. (DeMenezes Rule 43 Report, paragraph 6)
