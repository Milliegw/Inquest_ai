QUESTION: List any evidence presented by the police during the inquest that was later shown to be misleading, incorrect, inaccurate, or contradicted by other information.

RESPONSE:
Not found in the documents. The provided documents do not explicitly state that specific police evidence presented during the inquest was later shown to be misleading, incorrect, inaccurate, or contradicted by other information. However, it is mentioned that officers were cross-examined on the basis that their evidence was not the product of independent recollection, and allegations of dishonesty were made.
