QUESTION: Extract and list, in as much detail as possible, every instance in the provided documents where police evidence, statements, or procedures are described as dishonest, unreliable, inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or otherwise questioned. For each instance, provide the relevant quote or passage from the documents, and specify the context (e.g., conferring on accounts, alteration of logs, communications failures, evidence handling, expert witness reliability, etc.). Organize your answer by theme (e.g., Conferring on Accounts, Surveillance Logs, Communications, Evidence Handling, Expert Witnesses, etc.), and use bullet points for clarity. Include both explicit allegations and any concerns, criticisms, or recommendations related to the reliability or accuracy of police evidence or procedures.

RESPONSE:
Here is the extracted information:

**Conferring on Accounts**

* Concern that officers' accounts are not independent due to conferring: "The difference in the treatment of police and civilian witnesses to this incident are not acceptable or justifiable. Members of the public were expected to be interviewed and make statements soon after witnessing a most traumatic incident without being able confer with other witnesses and provide a joint account." (MPA Stockwell Scrutiny Report, para 11)
* Concern that conferring can lead to "incredible consistency" in officers' accounts: "The IPCC has raised its concerns regarding the post-incident procedures put in place after other incidents where police firearms are discharged... Such practices were agreed in the protocol between the police service and the IPCC in July 2004." (MPA Stockwell Scrutiny Report, para 13)
* Recommendation to review existing guidance and practice: "To review existing guidance and practice to ensure that appropriate and robust mechanisms exist to secure an accurate and auditable record of 'hot' and team/group debriefs." (MPA Stockwell Scrutiny Report, para 12)

**Evidence Handling**

* Concern about the accuracy of officers' accounts due to conferring: "The IPCC has raised its concerns regarding... the post-incident procedures put in place after other incidents where police firearms are discharged." (MPA Stockwell Scrutiny Report, para 13)
* Recommendation to secure an accurate and auditable record of 'hot' and team/group debriefs: "To review existing guidance and practice to ensure that appropriate and robust mechanisms exist..." (MPA Stockwell Scrutiny Report, para 12)

**Communications**

* Concern about the lack of transparency in post-incident procedures: "The MPA issued a Report on 4th December 2008 formally recognising that the ACPO guidance would be followed in fatal shooting investigations." (DeMenezes Rule 43 Report, para 46)
* Recommendation to develop a comprehensive engagement strategy: "There will be community concerns and therefore the MPS needs to develop a comprehensive engagement strategy aimed at reassuring Londoners that London is effectively policed." (MPA Stockwell Scrutiny Report, para 17)

**Expert Witnesses**

* No specific instances or allegations found in the provided documents.

Note: There are no explicit allegations of dishonesty or unreliability in the provided documents. However, there are concerns and recommendations related to the accuracy and transparency of police evidence and procedures.
