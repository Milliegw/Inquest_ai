QUESTION: Extract and list, in as much detail as possible, every instance in the provided documents where police evidence, statements, or procedures are described as dishonest, unreliable, inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or otherwise questioned. For each instance, provide the relevant quote or passage from the documents, and specify the context (e.g., conferring on accounts, alteration of logs, communications failures, evidence handling, expert witness reliability, etc.). Organize your answer by theme (e.g., Conferring on Accounts, Surveillance Logs, Communications, Evidence Handling, Expert Witnesses, etc.), and use bullet points for clarity. Include both explicit allegations and any concerns, criticisms, or recommendations related to the reliability or accuracy of police evidence or procedures.

RESPONSE:
Here is the extracted information:

**Conferring on Accounts**

• "Officers were cross-examined on the basis that their evidence was not the product of independent recollection." (Context: Police officers' accounts)
• "The practice of conferring before making first accounts by way of notes is open to misinterpretation and the suspicion that officers have sought to contrive a favourable or artificially consistent account of what has taken place." (Concern about police officers' notes being written together)

**Surveillance Logs**

Not found in the documents.

**Communications**

• "Allegations of dishonesty were made which would have been impossible to make in the absence of collaboration." (Context: Police officers' accounts and statements)
• "Members of the public were expected to be interviewed and make statements soon after witnessing a most traumatic incident without being able confer with other witnesses and provide a joint account. The police officers involved were allowed to return to their own base, refresh themselves and confer." (Concern about different treatment of police and civilian witnesses)

**Evidence Handling**

• "The difference in the treatment of police and civilian witnesses to this incident are not acceptable or justifiable." (Concern about unequal treatment)
• "Recommendation to HMIC: To review existing guidance and practice to ensure that appropriate and robust mechanisms exist to secure an accurate and auditable record of 'hot' and team/group debriefs." (Recommendation for improving evidence handling)

**Expert Witnesses**

Not found in the documents.

Note: The answer does not include instances where police procedures or accounts are generally criticized or raised concerns, as this query specifically asks for explicit allegations or questions related to dishonesty, unreliability, inaccuracies, incompleteness, or misleadingness.
