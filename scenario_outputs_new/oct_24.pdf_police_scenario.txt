RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

### 1. Detective Sergeant Piers Dingemans' Testimony

* **Arrival Time at New Scotland Yard**: Dingemans testified that he arrived at New Scotland Yard around 7:00 am on July 22, 2005 (Q20). This supports the police's version of events, as it suggests that he was part of the response team from the early morning.
* **Unarmed and in Plain Clothes**: Dingemans confirmed that he and his colleagues were unarmed and in plain clothes during their investigation (Q2-4). This corroborates the police's account of a non-confrontational approach.
* **Multiple Witness Statements**: Dingemans had made three witness statements about the events on July 22, 2005 (Q8-9), which could provide further details to support the police's version of events.

### Counterargument:

Some may argue that Dingemans' testimony is subjective and open to interpretation. However, his account provides specific details and dates, which can be used to corroborate or contradict other evidence.

### Recommendation:

To strengthen the police narrative, it would be beneficial to provide more information about the contents of Dingemans' three witness statements. Additionally, exploring the testimonies of other officers involved in the investigation could help to reinforce the police's version of events.

### 2. Operations Room Location

* **15th Floor Support Operations Room**: Dingemans confirmed that the operations room he visited was located on the 15th floor, not the 16th (Q23). This clarifies any potential confusion and provides a specific detail to support the police's account.
* **No Formal Shifts**: Dingemans explained that due to the extraordinary circumstances following the July 7 attacks, there were no formal shifts or teams in place (Q17-20). This context can help explain the police's response on July 22.

### Counterargument:

Some may question why Dingemans and his team did not have formal shifts or a clear plan of action. However, the extraordinary circumstances following the July 7 attacks provide a plausible explanation for this.

### Recommendation:

To address potential weaknesses in the police narrative, it would be useful to provide more information about the specific challenges faced by the police on July 22, 2005. This could help to contextualize their response and demonstrate the complexity of the situation.

In conclusion, Detective Sergeant Piers Dingemans' testimony provides key evidence supporting the police's version of events on July 22, 2005. While some may question certain details or circumstances, the specific information provided can be used to strengthen the police narrative and address potential counterarguments.
