RESPONSE:
**Challenge to Police Narrative: Potential Evidence Points**

As a legal assistant representing the family, I would focus on the following evidence points to challenge the police narrative:

### 1. Delay in Proceedings

* The court proceedings were delayed by 20 minutes (9:30 am - 9:50 am). This could be seen as an opportunity for the jury to deliberate and potentially sway their opinions.
	+ Reference: [Line 2-5]

Potential inconsistency: The police narrative may have been influenced by this delay, which could have impacted the jury's perception of the case.

### 2. Jury Deliberations

* The jury deliberated for over five hours (9:50 am - 4:30 pm), with no indication of a break or recess.
	+ Reference: [Line 16-20]

Potential inconsistency: This prolonged deliberation period could raise questions about the jury's engagement and attention span, potentially influencing their verdict.

### 3. Jury Instructions

* The court instructed the jury to start deliberations at 9:30 am the next day, with the option to begin earlier.
	+ Reference: [Line 7-11]

Potential inconsistency: This instruction could be seen as an attempt to manipulate the jury's deliberation process, potentially influencing their decision.

### 4. Adjournment

* The court adjourned at 4:32 pm, with no indication of a continuation or further instructions.
	+ Reference: [Line 14-16]

Potential inconsistency: This sudden adjournment could be seen as an attempt to conceal information or stall the proceedings, potentially undermining the police narrative.

**Actionable Next Steps for Legal Representatives**

1. Investigate the delay in proceedings and its potential impact on the jury's deliberation.
2. Request a detailed account of the jury's deliberations, including any breaks or recesses.
3. Challenge the court's instruction to start deliberations at 9:30 am the next day, arguing that it may have influenced the jury's decision.
4. Explore possible motives behind the sudden adjournment and request clarification on the reason for the interruption.

By focusing on these potential inconsistencies and contradictions, legal representatives can effectively challenge the police narrative and advocate for their clients' interests.
