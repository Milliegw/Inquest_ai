RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

1. **Recorded Strategy**
	* Evidence: Commissioner McDowall recorded his strategy in his "red book" (a form of day book) on July 22, 2005.
	* Analysis: The recording of the strategy provides an objective account of the police's plan to control the premises at Scotia Road through covert surveillance and challenge individuals leaving the area when it was deemed safe.
	* Counterargument: One could argue that this evidence is subjective and based on the commissioner's personal notes. However, the fact that a typed copy of these notes has been prepared and made available for review lends credibility to the recording.

2. **Gold Firearms Strategy**
	* Evidence: The police had a "Gold firearms strategy in respect of premises" (documented on page 1858 of Commissioner McDowall's red book).
	* Analysis: This evidence suggests that the police had a pre-planned approach to dealing with potential firearms threats, which aligns with their version of events.
	* Counterargument: One could argue that this evidence is specific to a particular scenario and may not be applicable to other situations. However, it demonstrates the police's preparedness for potential armed threats.

3. **Ripped-up Correspondence in Bomb Bag**
	* Evidence: Commissioner McDowall notes that there was "corres in bomb bag" relating to Girma and Jobseeker Stockwell.
	* Analysis: This evidence suggests that the police found correspondence related to an individual (Girma) and a job seeker application (Jobseeker Stockwell) in the rucksack, which may have been relevant to their investigation.
	* Counterargument: One could argue that this evidence is circumstantial and doesn't directly link Girma or Jobseeker Stockwell to the case. However, it provides context for the police's actions and highlights the importance of following up on these leads.

**Recommendations**

1. **Strengthen the Narrative**: To further support their version of events, the police could provide additional details about the Gold firearms strategy, including specific procedures and protocols.
2. **Address Weaknesses**: The police should address potential inconsistencies or ambiguities in their narrative, such as providing more context around the ripped-up correspondence and its relevance to the investigation.
3. **Enhance Credibility**: By making available a complete copy of Commissioner McDowall's red book (including all typed copies) and allowing for further review and analysis, the police can enhance the credibility of their evidence and demonstrate transparency in their investigation.
