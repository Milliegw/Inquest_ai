RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

1. **Witness Statement**

Anna Dunwoodie's initial statement to the police (not reviewed in this document) likely supported the police's version of events.

Sub-points:
* Anna was a witness to the events at Stockwell station on July 22, 2005.
* She gave an account to the police on that day, which may have been taken while she was still shaken by the incident.
* The statement would have been reviewed and revised later in 2005, with Anna identifying inaccuracies and correcting them.

Counterargument: The initial statement may not have been a comprehensive or accurate account of events, as Anna was still shaken by the incident. However, subsequent revisions to her statement may have addressed any potential inaccuracies.

Recommendation: Further analysis of Anna's initial statement could provide valuable insight into her original recollections and potentially strengthen the police narrative.

2. **Sketch Diagram**

The sketch diagram (document page 995) shows Anna's position in the carriage and Mr. de Menezes' location, which supports the police's account.

Sub-points:
* The sketch indicates that Anna was sitting on the same side of the carriage as Mr. de Menezes.
* She describes herself as being either in the middle seat or one to the left of it, with Mr. de Menezes potentially being in the very last seat or the one next to him.

Counterargument: The sketch may not be entirely accurate, as Anna admits to having possibly described her side of the carriage incorrectly.

Recommendation: Further analysis of the sketch and Anna's recollections could help clarify any potential inaccuracies and strengthen the police narrative.

3. **Computer Mock-up (Tab 35)**

The computer mock-up shows Mr. de Menezes in white towards the right, with Anna moved one seat over to the left.

Sub-points:
* The mock-up indicates that Mr. de Menezes was sitting one seat away from Anna.
* This supports the police's account of events and suggests that Anna's original statement (albeit revised) may have been accurate.

Counterargument: The computer mock-up is a reconstruction, which may not accurately reflect the actual seating arrangement on July 22, 2005.

Recommendation: Further analysis of the mock-up and any other available evidence could help clarify its reliability and strengthen the police narrative.

**Conclusion**

The provided documents suggest that Anna Dunwoodie's revised statement, sketch diagram, and computer mock-up support the police's version of events. However, potential counterarguments and inconsistencies highlight the need for further analysis and clarification to strengthen the police narrative.
