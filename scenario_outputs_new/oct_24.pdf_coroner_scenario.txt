RESPONSE:
**Summary of Main Findings**

**Arrival Time at New Scotland Yard**: Detective Sergeant Piers Dingemans arrived at New Scotland Yard around 7:00 am on July 22, 2005 (Q13).

**Work Schedule**: At the time, the team was not working formal shifts. Instead, they were coming in as soon as they could get there and being directed (SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT's follow-up question to Q20).

**Extraordinary Situation**: The situation was extraordinary due to the impact of 7 July (Q21). Dingemans himself had been involved in the aftermath of the 7 July bombings, working at Edgware Road tunnels for two weeks before moving on to other tasks (SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT's follow-up question to Q22).

**Working Hours**: The team was working exceptional hours. Dingemans mentioned that his last call the night before was around 2:00 or 3:00 am, and he had been involved in investigations arising out of the failed bombings the previous day (Q10, A).

**Key Evidence**: Dingemans' evidence is relevant to the coroner's decision-making as it provides insight into the team's work schedule, working hours, and experience with similar events.

**Ambiguities or Gaps in Evidence**: There are some ambiguities in Dingemans' testimony that may impact the decision-making process:

1. **Specific Arrival Time**: While Dingemans mentioned arriving around 7:00 am, he was not precise about the exact time.
2. **Work Schedule Formality**: The team's work schedule was informal, which might affect the assessment of their workload and stress levels.

**Areas for Further Investigation**: To further clarify the coroner's decision-making:

1. **Confirmation of Arrival Time**: Obtain a more precise arrival time to establish whether Dingemans' account is consistent with other evidence.
2. **Investigation into Work Schedule Formality**: Delve deeper into the team's work schedule and its impact on their workload, stress levels, and overall performance.

By addressing these ambiguities and gaps in evidence, the coroner can make a more informed decision based on the available information.
