RESPONSE:
**Challenging the Police Narrative: Key Evidence Points**

As a representative of the family, our focus would be on challenging the police narrative by highlighting inconsistencies and contradictions in their response to the Rule 43 Report. We would scrutinize each point raised by the Coroner, seeking evidence that undermines the Metropolitan Police Commissioner's claims.

**1. Command Structure**

The police claim they are contributing to a revised ACPO Manual of Guidance on the Police Use of Firearms (ACPO Manual 2009). However, we question whether this is sufficient to address concerns about the Gold Commander's role in supervising the operation after setting strategy. We would seek clarification on:

* What specific changes will be made to the command structure?
* How will the ACPO Manual 2009 ensure clarity on the continuing role of the Gold Commander?

Example: If the revised manual does not explicitly state the Gold Commander's responsibilities, it may perpetuate ambiguity.

**2. Action Taken**

The police claim they have taken action to address concerns raised by the Coroner. However, we would challenge the scope and effectiveness of these actions:

* What specific actions have been taken to address each concern?
* Are there any ongoing or planned initiatives that will tangibly improve procedures?

Example: If the police only provide general statements about reviewing operating procedures without providing concrete details, it may raise concerns about their commitment to meaningful change.

**3. Surveillance**

The police claim they are leading a national "Counter Terrorism Interoperability Project" to ensure consistency across forces. However, we would question:

* What specific measures will be taken to improve surveillance practices?
* How will the project address issues related to intelligence gathering and sharing?

Example: If the project only focuses on technical aspects of surveillance without addressing human factors or accountability mechanisms, it may not effectively prevent similar incidents.

**4. Firearms**

The police claim they are contributing to a revised ACPO Manual of Guidance on the Police Use of Firearms (ACPO Manual 2009). However, we would challenge:

* What specific changes will be made to firearms procedures?
* How will the manual address concerns about the use of firearms in counter-terrorism operations?

Example: If the revised manual does not include guidelines for de-escalation techniques or limitations on the use of deadly force, it may perpetuate concerns.

**Next Steps**

As legal representatives, we would:

1. Conduct a thorough review of the police's response to identify inconsistencies and contradictions.
2. Request additional information and clarification on specific points raised by the Coroner.
3. Investigate whether the police have taken meaningful action to address concerns or if they are merely paying lip service.
4. Prepare legal arguments based on our findings, highlighting areas where the police narrative falls short.

By challenging the police narrative through rigorous analysis of their response, we can ensure that justice is served and that the family's rights are protected.
