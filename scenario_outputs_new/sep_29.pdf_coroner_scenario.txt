RESPONSE:
**Summary of Main Findings**

This summary presents the key findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making based on the provided documents.

**Command Structure**

The command structure diagram provides a simplified representation of the Gold, Silver, Bronze, Scotia Road, and Portnall Road commands on September 29, 2008. Mr. Hough emphasized that this document omits certain individuals who don't fit neatly into the Gold, Silver, or Bronze categories.

* The Silver Commander is present for both Scotia Road and Portnall Road operations.
* The teams of surveillance officers, firearms officers, and SO13 arrest team are shown below the Silver Commander for Scotia Road.
* No Bronzes have been identified as yet, but it can be assumed that the team leaders of the surveillance and firearms teams may have been Bronze commanders.

**Key Evidence**

1. **Officer Ralph**: Officer Ralph is described as a Bronze commander for the firearms teams.
2. **Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke**: Mr. Clarke retired from the Metropolitan Police earlier this year, having served as Assistant Commissioner Specialist Operations since May 2002 and head of SO13 (Anti-Terrorist Branch) during that time.

**Ambiguities and Gaps in Evidence**

1. **Bronze Commanders**: Although Officer Ralph is identified as a Bronze commander for the firearms teams, it remains unclear who the other Bronze commanders were or what their roles entailed.
2. **Team Leaders**: The document does not provide information on the team leaders of the surveillance and firearms teams beyond mentioning that they may have been Bronze commanders.

**Suggestions for Further Investigation**

1. **Identity of Other Bronze Commanders**: Clarify the identities and roles of the other Bronze commanders involved in the Scotia Road and Portnall Road operations.
2. **Team Leaders' Roles**: Gather more information on the team leaders of the surveillance and firearms teams, including their specific responsibilities and involvement in the events.

By addressing these ambiguities and gaps in evidence, the coroner can make a more informed decision based on a comprehensive understanding of the command structure and key events involved.
