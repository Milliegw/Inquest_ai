RESPONSE:
Summary of Main Findings:

I. Timeline of Events

* The surveillance log states that JC left the number 2 bus at 9:48 and then caught the same bus at a stop further down the road at 9:52. (Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick's testimony, page 15)
* Sir Michael Wright's recollection is that JC got back on at the same stop where the bus had stopped.

II. Mr. Cremin's Log

* The log entry "Followed [arrow] surveillance into station, entered tube, sat inside, confronted by SO19 team, shot in head, non-compliant" was recorded by Mr. Purser (Silver) and passed on to the witness. (Mr. Hilliard's testimony, page 10-12)
* The entry indicates that SO19 team was involved in the incident.

III. Communication with SO19

* At 18:35, the Deputy Assistant Commissioner attended a meeting where a number of colleagues were present and discussed what had happened, what was happening now, and the intelligence update. (Deputy Assistant Commissioner's testimony, page 18-20)
* The Deputy Assistant Commissioner then visited Mr. Purser (Silver) in his office to check on his well-being and discuss the incident.
* The Deputy Assistant Commissioner mentioned that SO19 black team was self-explanatory, indicating that they were involved in the incident.

IV. Key Evidence

* MG11 is a statement form used for witness statements. (Deputy Assistant Commissioner's testimony, page 9)
* "SO19 black team, could there have been any confusion re: Kratos -- VE 'no'" suggests that Vince had answered "no" to a question about possible confusion regarding Kratos earlier on. (Deputy Assistant Commissioner's testimony, page 21)

Ambiguities and Gaps in Evidence:

* The timeline of events for JC's bus ride is unclear due to the conflicting accounts.
* The exact nature of the incident involving SO19 team and JC at the tube station remains ambiguous.

Areas for Further Investigation:

* Clarify the timeline of events for JC's bus ride
* Gather more information about the incident involving SO19 team and JC at the tube station
