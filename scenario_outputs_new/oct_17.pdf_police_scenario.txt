RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

### MASTS Operation Objectives

The first piece of evidence supporting the police's version of events is the objectives of the MASTS operation itself.

* The two-fold object of the exercise was to arrest and detain any suspect or subject coming from address 21, and to gather intelligence if possible.
	+ This objective is supported by quotes from Detective Chief Inspector Gregory Purser: "The object of the exercise... was two-fold... Firstly to arrest and detain any suspect or subject coming from number 21; that's the first object? Secondly, there was another object, which was intelligence gathering if it were possible?" (Questions from MR MANSFIELD, lines 15-20)

### Preventing Suspects from Boarding Public Transport

The second piece of evidence supporting the police's version of events is their objective to prevent suspects from boarding public transport.

* The desired objective was to prevent the suspect or subject from getting on a bus or tube train, as they had done previously.
	+ This objective is supported by quotes from Detective Chief Inspector Gregory Purser: "So that it had to be done if it could be away from the Scotia Road address so it didn't compromise it and nobody was alerted to it, but before the person, as it were, got on a bus or a tube train; that was the desired object?" (Questions from MR MANSFIELD, lines 9-14)

### Intelligence Gathering

The third piece of evidence supporting the police's version of events is their objective to gather intelligence.

* The goal was to gather intelligence without compromising the address and not trail suspects all over London.
	+ This objective is supported by quotes from Detective Chief Inspector Gregory Purser: "You don't want to risk compromising the address but you don't want to trail them all over London to find out what they have to say, because then you leave fewer people back at the address if somebody else comes out you want to ask questions of." (Questions from MR MANSFIELD, lines 22-26)

### Envisioned Scenario

The fourth piece of evidence supporting the police's version of events is the envisioned scenario for stopping suspects.

* The aspiration was to stop one person, not every unidentified individual coming out of address 21.
	+ This vision is supported by quotes from Detective Chief Inspector Gregory Purser: "What I envisaged was that we might only have to stop one person... We might only have to stop one person and if you actually look at it, unfortunate" (Questions from MR MANSFIELD, lines 10-14)

### Conclusion

The police's version of events is supported by the objectives of the MASTS operation, their desire to prevent suspects from boarding public transport, the need for intelligence gathering without compromising the address, and their envisioned scenario for stopping suspects.

**Recommendations**

To strengthen the police narrative or address weaknesses:

* Provide more context about the specific circumstances leading up to Jean Charles de Menezes' death.
* Clarify how the police's actions were in line with their objectives and envisioned scenario.
* Address potential counterarguments by providing additional evidence or testimony from other officers involved in the operation.
