RESPONSE:
**Evidence Analysis: Challenging the Police Narrative**

As a legal representative for the family, our goal is to identify potential inconsistencies or contradictions in the police narrative that can be used to challenge their account of events. Based on the provided documents, we will focus on the following evidence points:

### 1. Chief Superintendent Steve Swain's Witness Statement

* **Inconsistency:** Swain's initial witness statement was made in September this year, which implies he may have had limited information at that time.
	+ Reference: Document line 19-20 ("That was to deal with the policies that I have just referred to?... Yes.")
* **Potential challenge:** As a former Chief Superintendent, Swain's experience and knowledge of police strategies and tactics could be used to argue that he may have had access to more information at the time of his initial statement.

### 2. Police Officer Involvement in the Operation

* **Inconsistency:** Swain was not involved in the operation run from the 16th floor operations room on July 22nd, but it is unclear what role he played on that day.
	+ Reference: Document line 15-17 ("On 22 July, I don't think you were involved actually in the operation run from the 16th floor operations room?... No, I wasn't.")
* **Potential challenge:** As a former Chief Superintendent, Swain may have had a role in overseeing or coordinating other officers on that day. This could be used to argue that his lack of involvement in the operation is inconsistent with his level of experience and seniority.

### 3. Timelines and Schedules

* **Inconsistency:** The court schedule for the next few working days was discussed, but it is unclear what specific information or evidence will be presented during this time.
	+ Reference: Document line 1-25 (Court discussion on timetable and witness schedule)
* **Potential challenge:** As a legal representative, we could use this uncertainty to our advantage by requesting more information about the court's plans and questioning the relevance of certain witnesses or evidence.

### Next Steps for Legal Representatives:

1. Review Chief Superintendent Swain's witness statement in detail to identify any potential inconsistencies or contradictions.
2. Investigate further into the role Steve Swain played on July 22nd, including any potential interactions with other officers or officials.
3. Request additional information about the court's plans and schedule to better prepare for upcoming evidence and challenges.
4. Analyze the relevance of each witness and piece of evidence presented to date, identifying potential areas where the police narrative may be challenged.

By focusing on these evidence points and analyzing the potential inconsistencies and contradictions, we can effectively challenge the police narrative and advocate for the family's interests in court.
