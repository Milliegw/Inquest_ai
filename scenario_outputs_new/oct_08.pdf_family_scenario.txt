RESPONSE:
**Challenging the Police Narrative: Key Evidence Points**

As a legal assistant representing the family, I would focus on the following evidence points to challenge the police narrative:

### 1. Identification Process

* Commissioner Dick's statement that identification is being "firmed up" around 9:52 am (line 13)
* The revelation that surveillance officers and firearms officers did not have copies of CCTV or gym card photographs during this period (lines 20-21)

Analysis: This evidence suggests that the police may not have had sufficient visual evidence to confirm Smith's identity at the time of his shooting. If the police were relying on incomplete or unreliable information, it raises questions about their justification for using lethal force.

Next steps: Request additional information on the identification process and any potential biases or flaws in the system.

### 2. Policy Changes

* Commissioner Dick's statement that policy has not changed regarding identification (line 24)
* The implication that there may have been changes to police procedures since the 2005 events and the subsequent trial (lines 22-23)

Analysis: This evidence creates a potential inconsistency between what Commissioner Dick knows now versus what she knew at the time of the shooting. It also raises questions about whether any policy changes might have affected the police's response to the situation.

Next steps: Request documentation on any policy changes or reviews conducted since 2005, and investigate whether these changes might have impacted the police's actions on July 22, 2005.

### 3. Management Board Meetings

* Commissioner Dick's role as a deputy to an Assistant Commissioner and her attendance at management board meetings (lines 6-8)
* The implication that there may have been internal reviews or discussions about the Stockwell operation and its aftermath since the trial (lines 21-23)

Analysis: This evidence suggests that Commissioner Dick may have had access to information or insights from within the Metropolitan Police Service, potentially contradicting the police's official narrative.

Next steps: Request documentation on any internal reviews or discussions related to the Stockwell operation and its aftermath, and investigate whether these discussions might have informed Commissioner Dick's understanding of the events.

### 4. Continuous Overview

* Commissioner Dick's statement that there has been a continuous overview of the implications for policing of the Stockwell operation (line 23)
* The implication that this review may have led to changes or improvements within the Metropolitan Police Service (lines 24-25)

Analysis: This evidence raises questions about what specifically changed or improved within the police service since 2005, and whether these changes might have affected the police's response to similar situations in the future.

Next steps: Request documentation on any specific changes or improvements implemented within the Metropolitan Police Service since 2005, and investigate whether these changes might have impacted the police's actions on July 22, 2005.

In conclusion, as a legal assistant representing the family, I would focus on these evidence points to challenge the police narrative. By requesting additional information and documentation, we can better understand the context and potential inconsistencies in Commissioner Dick's testimony. This will enable us to develop a comprehensive strategy for challenging the police's account of events and seeking justice for the family.
