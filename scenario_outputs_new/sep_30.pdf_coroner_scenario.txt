RESPONSE:
**Summary of Main Findings**

The main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. **Detective Chief Inspector Michael Forteath's role**: He was a staff officer to Mr. McDowall in July 2005, initially as a Detective Inspector (Q7) and later as a loggist (Q4).
2. **The attempted bombings**: On July 21st, DCI Forteath became aware of the attempted bombings and went to the SO13 reserve area at New Scotland Yard (A3).
3. **Appointment of Senior Investigating Officers**: Detective Superintendent McKenna was appointed as Senior Investigating Officer for the bombing investigation (Q6), while Mr. Boutcher was appointed Senior Investigating Officer for the manhunt (Q12).

**Key Evidence and Quotes**

1. **Meeting notes**: DCI Forteath kept records of key meetings, decisions, or events that may be salient at a later date (A8-9). These notes include details of a meeting involving senior management team members on July 21st (Q17).
2. **Log entries**: The typewritten log entries show the timing and participants in various meetings, including a video conference with officers from Leeds (Q15-16).

**Ambiguities or Gaps in Evidence**

1. **Lack of detail on specific investigative actions**: While DCI Forteath's testimony provides some insight into the events surrounding the attempted bombings, there may be gaps in information about specific investigative actions taken during this time.
2. **Inconsistencies between accounts**: There is no direct evidence to contradict or support the accounts provided by DCI Forteath, Mr. McDowall, and other witnesses.

**Areas for Further Investigation**

1. **Additional log entries**: Reviewing additional log entries may provide more detailed information about investigative actions taken during this time.
2. **Corroborating evidence from other sources**: Gathering evidence from other sources, such as police reports or witness statements, could help fill gaps in the timeline and clarify investigative actions.

By considering these findings, key evidence, ambiguities, and areas for further investigation, the coroner can make an informed decision about the case.
