RESPONSE:
**Summary of Main Findings**

The main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. **Inquiry Concerning Portnall Road**: Alan's notes (page 375) indicate an inquiry concerning Portnall Road in March 2004. This finding is significant as it may relate to a previous event or incident, which could impact the investigation.
2. **Alan's Notes Dating**: The notes were written after the event (2005), not in 2004 as initially suspected.

**Key Evidence and Quotes**

* "14/03/04" on Alan's notes relates to an inquiry concerning Portnall Road at that time (MR HILLIARD, lines 14-16).
* It is unlikely that the notes were written before the event (SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT, line 23).

**Ambiguities and Gaps in Evidence**

* The exact nature of the inquiry concerning Portnall Road in March 2004 remains unclear.
* Further investigation may be necessary to clarify the relationship between this inquiry and the main event under investigation.

**Recommendations for Further Investigation**

1. Gather more information about the inquiry concerning Portnall Road in March 2004, including its purpose, scope, and findings.
2. Examine any relevant documents or records related to this inquiry to determine its relevance to the main event.

By addressing these ambiguities and gaps in evidence, the coroner can make a more informed decision based on a comprehensive understanding of the facts.
