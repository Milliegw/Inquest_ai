RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

This process helps identify areas for improvement and implementation of protocols or safeguards to reduce the risk of wrongful shootings.
2. **Training and Equipping Staff**
	* Quote: "The safeguards will be the way in which you train and equip your staff to do the job." (Line 17-18)
	* In-depth analysis: The police highlight the importance of proper training and equipment for their firearms officers, which implies a focus on professional development and capability. This attention to detail may help mitigate risks associated with perceptual distortion or other human factors.

	* Potential counterargument: The police's commitment to debriefing may not be sufficient or effective in addressing weaknesses.
