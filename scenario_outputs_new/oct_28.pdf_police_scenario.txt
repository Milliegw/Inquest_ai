RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

### 1. Chief Justice Sir Michael Wright's Statements

* **Quote:** "I have come to the conclusion that I need take no further steps in respect of that individual..." (line 20-21)
	+ This statement suggests that the police have investigated the incident and found no wrongdoing by the photographer.
	+ It also implies that the chief justice has reviewed the situation and is satisfied with the outcome.

### 2. Police Chief's Guidance

* **Quote:** "The police on what you have said will regard that as a contempt of court and take the necessary action." (line 11-12)
	+ This quote indicates that the police are aware of the chief justice's warning and will enforce it if necessary.
	+ It also implies that the police have a clear understanding of their role in maintaining the anonymity of witnesses.

### 3. Decision to Install Barriers

* **Quote:** "In future, barriers will be put to the side of the witness entrance gate..." (line 5-6)
	+ This decision demonstrates the police's commitment to preventing similar incidents from occurring in the future.
	+ It also shows that the police are taking proactive steps to ensure the anonymity of witnesses.

**Potential Counterarguments or Inconsistencies**

* One potential counterargument is that the police may have failed to properly investigate the incident, leading to a lack of concrete evidence supporting their version of events. However, Chief Justice Sir Michael Wright's statement and the decision to install barriers suggest that the police did conduct an investigation and found no wrongdoing.
* Another potential inconsistency is that the police may have been too lenient with the photographer, allowing them to escape punishment for attempting to breach witness anonymity. However, the chief justice's warning and the police's decision to regard future attempts as a contempt of court suggest that the police are taking steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

**Recommendations**

* To strengthen the police narrative, it may be helpful to provide more specific details about the investigation into the incident, such as the number of officers involved or any witness statements collected.
* The police should also consider providing additional training for photographers and other journalists on the importance of maintaining witness anonymity and the consequences of breaching it.
* To address potential weaknesses in their narrative, the police may want to anticipate and prepare responses to counterarguments or inconsistencies that could arise.
