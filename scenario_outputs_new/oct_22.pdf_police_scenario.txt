RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

### 1. Surveillance Team Briefing

* The witness, "Harry," was part of a surveillance team that received a briefing at New Scotland Yard on July 22nd.
	+ Supported by: Witness testimony (Qs 19-21)
* The briefing was given by Mr. Whiddett and an officer referred to as Colin.
	+ Supported by: Witness testimony (Q 21)

### 2. Suspects' Names and Photographs

* The surveillance team was briefed on a number of suspects, including names and photographs.
	+ Supported by: Witness testimony (Qs 4-6)
* One photograph can be shown up on screen, tab 37 of the jury bundle.
	+ Supported by: Witness testimony (Q 9)

### 3. Clarification on "Contain"

* Harry asked for clarification on what the word "contain" meant in terms of surveillance of the suspects.
	+ Supported by: Witness testimony (Qs 14-17)
* The briefing did not provide clear instructions, prompting Harry's inquiry.
	+ Supported by: Witness testimony (A. Yes, I did., Q 16)

### Potential Counterarguments or Inconsistencies:

* None apparent from the provided documents.

**Recommendations for Strengthening the Police Narrative or Addressing Weaknesses:**

1. **Provide additional context**: While the witness's testimony provides insight into the briefing and subsequent surveillance, more information about the broader investigation and the significance of the suspects would strengthen the police narrative.
2. **Corroborate evidence**: Verifying the existence of tab 37 in the jury bundle or obtaining statements from other team members could provide additional credibility to Harry's account.
3. **Clarify "contain" instructions**: Further information on what exactly the term "contain" meant in the context of surveillance would help address any potential confusion or inconsistencies.

By addressing these areas, the police can further solidify their version of events and improve the overall coherence of their narrative.
