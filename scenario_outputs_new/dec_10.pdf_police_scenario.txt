PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events? Provide an in-depth analysis of each supporting piece of evidence, referencing specific document content or quotes where possible. Format the response with clear headings and sub-points for each evidence item, address potential counterarguments or inconsistencies, and conclude with recommendations for strengthening the police narrative or addressing weaknesses.

RESPONSE:
**No Evidence Found**

The provided documents do not contain any evidence that supports the police's version of events. The proceedings are focused on jury deliberations and instructions, but there is no mention of specific evidence or facts that support the police's narrative.

In fact, the documents only refer to majority verdicts, unanimous decisions, and jury discussions, but do not provide any details about the case itself. Therefore, it is not possible to analyze supporting pieces of evidence or identify potential counterarguments or inconsistencies.

**Recommendations**

To strengthen the police narrative and address weaknesses, I would recommend providing more context about the case, including relevant facts, witness testimony, and physical evidence. This would allow for a more comprehensive analysis of the evidence and a clearer understanding of the events in question.

Additionally, it may be helpful to provide additional information about the jury deliberations, such as specific questions or concerns they have raised during their discussions. This could help to identify areas where the police narrative is weak and where further investigation or clarification is needed.

Ultimately, without more information about the case itself, it is not possible to analyze supporting evidence or make recommendations for strengthening the police narrative.
