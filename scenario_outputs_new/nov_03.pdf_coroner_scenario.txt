RESPONSE:
**Summary of Main Findings**

1. **Anna Dunwoodie's Witness Account**: Anna Dunwoodie, a witness to events at Stockwell station on July 22, 2005, provided an account to police on that day. She later reviewed and revised this account, correcting inaccuracies and producing a nine-page statement in 2005.
2. **Carriage Positioning**: Dunwoodie boarded the Northern Line train going northbound at Tooting Bec station and entered a carriage towards the front of the train. She occupied the same row of seats as Mr. de Menezes, with her position being on the same side of the carriage as his.
3. **Sketch Evidence**: A sketch produced by Dunwoodie shows her position in the carriage, describing herself sitting in either one of two seats. The sketch also depicts a couple opposite her and Mr. de Menezes' position to her right.

**Key Evidence**

* Anna Dunwoodie's original police statement (not shown in the provided document) was later reviewed and revised due to inaccuracies.
* The nine-page statement, produced in 2005, is referenced as the primary source of information for this witness.
* The sketch evidence shows Anna Dunwoodie's position in the carriage, with Mr. de Menezes situated to her right.

**Ambiguities and Gaps**

1. **Inaccuracies in Original Statement**: The original police statement contained inaccuracies, which were later corrected in the nine-page statement. This raises concerns about the reliability of early witness accounts.
2. **Uncertainty in Carriage Positioning**: While Anna Dunwoodie provided a sketch to illustrate her position in the carriage, there is still some uncertainty regarding Mr. de Menezes' exact seat placement (being either in the very last seat or the one next to it).
3. **Limited Information from Original Statement**: The original police statement is not provided in the document, limiting the information available for analysis.

**Areas for Further Investigation**

1. **Original Police Statement**: Obtain and review the original police statement to understand its contents and how it differs from the revised account.
2. **Carriage Positioning Clarification**: Seek further clarification on Mr. de Menezes' exact seat placement in the carriage, potentially through additional witness testimony or physical evidence.

These findings and ambiguities will inform the coroner's decision-making process, highlighting the need for a thorough examination of Anna Dunwoodie's account and any potential inconsistencies or uncertainties that may impact the investigation.
