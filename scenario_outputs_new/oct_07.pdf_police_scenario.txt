RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

### Surveillance Log

* The surveillance log states that JC left the number 2 bus at 9:48 and then caught the same bus again at 9:52.
	+ This suggests that JC did not get back on at the same stop where the bus stopped initially, contrary to Sir Michael Wright's recollection.

### Mr. Cremin's Log

* A passage in Mr. Cremin's log reads: "Followed [arrow] surveillance into station, entered tube, sat inside, confronted by SO19 team, shot in head, non-compliant."
	+ This entry provides evidence that JC was confronted and shot by the SO19 team while sitting in the tube.

### Logistical Notes

* The note from Mr. Mellody at 9:00 am states that it will be added to the jury bundle at divider 49.
	+ While not directly related to the police's version of events, this note demonstrates a systematic and organized approach to documentation, which bolsters confidence in the accuracy of other evidence.

### Analysis

* The combined evidence from the surveillance log and Mr. Cremin's log provides a detailed account of JC's actions and confrontation with the SO19 team.
* The passage in Mr. Cremin's log specifically mentions the confrontation and shooting, which supports the police's version of events.
* The logistical notes demonstrate a well-organized documentation process, increasing confidence in the accuracy of other evidence.

### Potential Counterarguments or Inconsistencies

* Sir Michael Wright's recollection differs from the surveillance log regarding JC's actions at 9:48. This inconsistency could be addressed by further investigation or clarification on the exact events.
* The passage in Mr. Cremin's log does not explicitly state that the SO19 team shot JC. However, it mentions JC being "shot in head" and "non-compliant," which could be interpreted as a shooting incident.

### Recommendations

* To strengthen the police narrative, consider further investigation or clarification on the events surrounding 9:48 to resolve the inconsistency between Sir Michael Wright's recollection and the surveillance log.
* Consider including additional evidence or testimony from other witnesses to corroborate the passage in Mr. Cremin's log and provide a more comprehensive account of the confrontation and shooting.
* Emphasize the logistical notes as an example of the police's attention to detail and commitment to accurate documentation, which can help build credibility with the jury.
