PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events? Provide an in-depth analysis of each supporting piece of evidence, referencing specific document content or quotes where possible. Format the response with clear headings and sub-points for each evidence item, address potential counterarguments or inconsistencies, and conclude with recommendations for strengthening the police narrative or addressing weaknesses.

RESPONSE:
Unfortunately, there is no evidence presented in this transcript that supports the police's version of events. The transcript only discusses the deliberations and instructions given to the jury, as well as submissions made by counsel.

Therefore, I will not be providing an in-depth analysis of any supporting piece of evidence, as none exists in this document.
