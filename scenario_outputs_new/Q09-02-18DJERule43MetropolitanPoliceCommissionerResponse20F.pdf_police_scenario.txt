### Conclusion

While the evidence presented supports the police's version of events, it is essential to recognize potential weaknesses and areas for improvement. To strengthen the narrative, the police should:

1. Provide more detailed information on the Counter Terrorism Interoperability Project's progress and outcomes.
2. Offer specific updates on revisions to ACPO manuals and how they will improve procedures.
3. Share findings and lessons learned from internal reviews and reports.

By addressing these areas, the police can enhance transparency and demonstrate their commitment to improving their response to counter-terrorism incidents.
