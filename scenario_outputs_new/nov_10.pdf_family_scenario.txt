**Evidence Analysis**

The provided documents present a series of statements made by Alpha 1 (codename) on July 21-22, 2005, and October 22, 2008. As a legal assistant representing the family, our goal is to identify potential inconsistencies or contradictions in the police narrative.

### 1. Team Leader for Orange Firearms Team

* Alpha 1 was the team leader for the orange firearms team on July 21-22, 2005.
* The team consisted of himself and ten other officers.

This evidence provides a foundation for understanding the events surrounding the case. However, it may be useful to clarify specific roles within the team or details about their training and experience.

### 2. Late Turn Duty

* Alpha 1's tour of duty would have concluded at 11:00 pm on July 21, but he was retained on duty in support of an SO12/SO13 operation.
* The late turn team is responsible for supporting operations that require additional personnel.

This evidence suggests that the police were involved in a specific operation on July 21-22, but the details about the operation are not provided. It may be useful to obtain more information about this operation and its connection to the case at hand.

### 3. Original Notes and Witness Statement

* Alpha 1 made original notes on July 22, 2005.
* The original notes were later typed out into a witness statement form.

This evidence provides a timeline for when Alpha 1's statements were made. However, it may be useful to compare the original notes with the typed witness statement to identify any discrepancies or inconsistencies.

### 4. Retention on Duty and Operation

* Alpha 1 was retained on duty in support of an SO12/SO13 operation.
* The late turn team would typically conclude their duties at 11:00 pm, but they were kept on duty due to the ongoing operation.

This evidence raises questions about the nature of the operation and why the police needed additional personnel. It may be useful to obtain more information about this operation and its connection to the case at hand.

**Next Steps for Legal Representatives**

1. Obtain more information about the SO12/SO13 operation and its connection to the case.
2. Compare original notes with typed witness statement to identify any discrepancies or inconsistencies.
3. Clarify specific roles within the team, including training and experience.
4. Investigate potential inconsistencies between Alpha 1's statements and other evidence in the case.

By analyzing these pieces of evidence and identifying potential inconsistencies or contradictions, legal representatives can challenge the police narrative and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the events surrounding the case.
