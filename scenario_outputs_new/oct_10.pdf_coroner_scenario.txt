RESPONSE:
**Summary of Main Findings**

The main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

* **Strategic Decision-Making**: The witness, Pat, was aware that a strategy had been written on a white board regarding persons leaving addresses under surveillance (Page 134, bottom). This strategy was attributed to Commander Dick and involved assessing, stopping with suitable precautions, and arresting or speaking to individuals who left the address.
* **Reporting Incidents**: Pat understood that he would have to report incidents to the SIO (Senior Investigating Officer) so a strategic decision could be made regarding whether to stop individuals from Scotia Road (Page 135).
* **Overarching Policy**: There was no recollection of an overarching policy that identified suspects or possible suspects and prevented them from leaving the scene. Pat understood the concept, but had no memory of this specific policy.

**Key Evidence and Quotes**

1. The strategy written on the white board (Page 134):
"had been written in green and was attributed to Commander Dick. In effect, all persons seen to leave the various addresses would be assessed, stopped with suitable precautions and then arrested or spoken to."
2. Reporting incidents to the SIO:
"I raised this issue to Brian several times... I was told to inform the SIO when any persons left the address so a strategic decision could be made."
3. No recollection of overarching policy:
"I have no recollection of that, sir." (in response to question about preventing suspects from leaving the scene)

**Ambiguities and Gaps in Evidence**

1. **Unclear Timeline**: The document does not provide a clear timeline for when Pat became aware of the strategy or when he raised concerns with Brian.
2. **Limited Context**: There is limited context provided regarding the specific operation or event being discussed, which may impact the coroner's decision-making.

**Suggested Areas for Further Investigation**

1. **Timeline Clarification**: To clarify the timeline and sequence of events surrounding Pat's awareness of the strategy and his concerns with Brian.
2. **Operation Context**: To provide more context about the specific operation or event being discussed, which could help clarify the significance of Pat's testimony.

By addressing these ambiguities and gaps in evidence, further investigation may provide a clearer understanding of the circumstances leading up to the coroner's decision-making.
