RESPONSE:
**Summary of Main Findings**

The jury has reached a majority short-form verdict on all questions except one (question 4(a)), where they have reached an impasse with no minimum of eight agreeing.

**Key Evidence and Quotes**

* The jury's note states that they have "reached a majority short form verdict with the same majority for all but one of the questions, with the majority consisting of the same jury members" (para. 18-20).
* The impasse on question 4(a) is due to the fact that the same majority cannot be reached, and the minority members are different from those of the other questions (para. 22).

**Decision-Making Implications**

The coroner must now consider how to proceed in light of this impasse.

**Suggestions for Further Investigation or Clarification**

* The coroner should ask the foreman if there is any reasonable possibility that the jury can break the impasse with a further period of time (para. 8-10).
* If the answer is "no", the coroner may need to consider abandoning question 4(a) altogether.

**Ambiguities or Gaps in Evidence**

* The exact voting split reached by the jury on question 4(a) is not disclosed in the note, as it is considered sensitive information (para. 6).
* It is unclear what factors contributed to the impasse on question 4(a), and further investigation may be necessary to understand the root cause of the deadlock.
