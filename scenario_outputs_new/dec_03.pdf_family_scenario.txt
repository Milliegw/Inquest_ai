RESPONSE:
**Evidence Analysis: Challenging the Police Narrative**

As a legal assistant representing the family, I would focus on the following key evidence points to challenge the police narrative:

### 1. Chief Inspector Southworth's Statement (10 November)

* **Inconsistency:** Southworth initially stated that the MPS/DVLA designated point of contact was not accessible outside office hours.
* **Contradiction:** However, he later accepted that his understanding was erroneous and corrected his evidence, stating that DC Martin Edwards' witness statement revealed that DVLA liaison officers, including himself, were available 24/7.
* **Actionable next step:** Question Southworth about the timeline of his correction and why it took so long to acknowledge the mistake. Challenge the police narrative by highlighting the initial false information provided.

### 2. Detective Constable Martin Edwards' Statement (13 November)

* **Key evidence:** Edwards revealed that as a DVLA liaison officer, he was available 24/7 to facilitate checks.
* **Contrast:** This contradicts Southworth's initial statement, which implied that the office in Swansea couldn't be accessed outside office hours.
* **Actionable next step:** Highlight the inconsistency between Southworth and Edwards' statements. Question whether this mistake could have led to delays or inaccuracies in the investigation.

### 3. Timeline of Research Intelligence Instructions (22 July)

* **Inconsistency:** The timeline suggests that research intelligence instructions were given shortly after 4 am on 22 July, but photographs from DVLA did not come through until midday on the same day.
* **Questionable delay:** This raises questions about the efficiency and effectiveness of the investigation. Challenge the police narrative by highlighting potential delays or inefficiencies in the process.

### 4. Sir Michael Wright's Summing-Up (continued)

* **Inconsistency:** Wright mentioned that despite Detective Chief Inspector Southworth explaining how photographs or intelligence from these sources can take some hours to get, the DVLA photographs did not come through until after the shooting had occurred.
* **Questionable communication:** Challenge the police narrative by questioning whether there was a breakdown in communication or ineffective coordination between departments, leading to delays and inaccuracies.

**Actionable next steps for legal representatives:**

1. Request clarification on the timeline of research intelligence instructions and how they were implemented.
2. Question Chief Inspector Southworth about his correction and why it took so long to acknowledge the mistake.
3. Highlight the inconsistencies and contradictions between statements and challenge the police narrative.
4. Investigate potential delays or inefficiencies in the investigation process.

By focusing on these evidence points, legal representatives can effectively challenge the police narrative, identify potential inconsistencies, and uncover the truth about the events surrounding the case.
