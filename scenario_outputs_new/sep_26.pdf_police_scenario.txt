RESPONSE:
**Supporting Evidence for the Police's Version of Events**

### 1. Surveillance Team's Presence at Scotia Road

* **Evidence:** John McDowall's testimony (September 26, 2008)
* **Quote:** "I believe [Frank] was on his own in the van... He didn't have a backup, but if he felt he was going to be away from his position for any length of time, the option may have existed to replace him with another member of the surveillance team." (Pages 1-2)
* **Analysis:** The police's version of events suggests that Frank was alone in the van when keeping watch outside Scotia Road. This testimony provides supporting evidence for this claim.
* **Counterargument:** One potential counterargument is that Frank may have had a backup or another member of the surveillance team with him, which could contradict the police's narrative.

### 2. Intelligence Unit's Research on Residents

* **Evidence:** John McDowall's testimony (September 26, 2008)
* **Quote:** "The intelligence unit here would have been looking to research who was shown as living on the voters' register." (Page 9-10)
* **Analysis:** The police's version of events suggests that the intelligence unit researched residents by using the voters' register. This testimony provides supporting evidence for this claim.
* **Inconsistency:** However, it is unclear whether this research would have included information about Mr. Osman, as Sir Michael Wright notes: "Whether of course anybody like Mr. Osman would have been registered on the voters' register is another matter." (Page 18)

### Recommendation:

To strengthen their narrative, the police should focus on providing more detailed information about the intelligence unit's research methods and any additional sources they may have used to gather information about residents. Additionally, they could address potential inconsistencies, such as whether Mr. Osman was registered on the voters' register.

**Additional Recommendations:**

1. **Provide context:** The police could provide more context about the surveillance team's activities on the day of the incident and their overall strategy.
2. **Address counterarguments:** The police should anticipate and address potential counterarguments or inconsistencies in their narrative to strengthen its credibility.
3. **Flesh out supporting evidence:** The police should provide more detailed information about each piece of supporting evidence, including any additional documentation or witness testimony that could further support their version of events.
