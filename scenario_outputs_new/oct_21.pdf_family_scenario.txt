RESPONSE:
**Challenge to Police Narrative: Evidence Analysis**

As a legal assistant representing the family, we would focus on the following pieces of evidence to challenge the police narrative:

### 1. Timeframe for Identifying Nettle Tip

The police narrative suggests that James identified Nettle Tip between 9:50 and 9:57 am. However, James's testimony states that he had only been on the follow-up for a short time and had not yet consulted with other team members to gain a gauge on what they felt about the identity (lines 10-14). This inconsistency in the timeframe could indicate that the police narrative is exaggerated or inaccurate.

### 2. Percentage-Based Identification

The police narrative implies that James was asked to provide a percentage-based identification of Nettle Tip, which he found unusual and reacted to negatively (lines 15-20). However, James's testimony highlights the complexity of this request, stating that it would require him to gather opinions from other team members and calculate an average or mode (lines 16-18). This could suggest that the police narrative is oversimplifying the situation.

### 3. Lack of Consultation with Team Members

James's testimony reveals that he had not yet consulted with his team members to gain a gauge on what they felt about the identity, despite being asked by Pat from the ops room (lines 20-22). This lack of consultation could raise questions about the accuracy and reliability of James's identification.

### 4. Phone Call with Pat

The police narrative does not provide details about the phone call between James and Pat. However, James's testimony describes the call as Pat asking for a percentage-based identification, which James found unusual (lines 20-22). This could indicate that the police narrative is selectively presenting information or omitting important context.

**Actionable Next Steps**

Based on this analysis, our team would focus on:

1. Seeking additional details about the phone call between James and Pat to clarify any inconsistencies.
2. Investigating whether other team members had an opportunity to consult with each other before identifying Nettle Tip.
3. Determining whether the police narrative has exaggerated or distorted the timeframe for identifying Nettle Tip.
4. Developing a comprehensive understanding of the percentage-based identification request and its implications for the case.

By challenging these inconsistencies and contradictions, we can potentially undermine the police narrative and provide a more accurate representation of events to support our clients' interests.
