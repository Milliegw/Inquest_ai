RESPONSE:
**Summary of Main Findings**

The main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. **Objective**: The objective was to detain a subject or suspect who emerges from the block of flats at Scotia Road, while ensuring they are not too close to Scotia Road that it compromises the covert operation, nor too far away that they can get on public transport.
	* Quote: "it was as simple as that" (Page 1, Line 24)
2. **Requirements**: To implement this idea, a Silver officer with control of the location and dual purpose (surveillance and firearms) is needed.
	* Quote: "a dual purpose Silver?" (Page 2, Line 14-15)
3. **Reconnaissance**: A reconnaissance of the area is necessary to determine the proximity within which the subject can be detained.
	* Quote: "somebody's got to sort the area out and sort of have a rough idea of what's possible" (Page 4, Line 6)

**Key Evidence**

The key evidence supporting these findings includes:

1. The officer's understanding of the objective and requirements for implementing it.
2. The need for a Silver officer with dual purpose capabilities.

**Ambiguities and Gaps in Evidence**

There are some ambiguities and gaps in the evidence that could impact the decision-making process:

1. **Lack of clarity on the original plan**: While it is mentioned that Mr. McDowall had set his strategy, which embraced this idea, there is no further information provided.
2. **Uncertainty about the reconnaissance process**: The document does not specify how the reconnaissance would typically be done or who would perform it.

**Suggestions for Further Investigation**

To address these ambiguities and gaps in evidence, the following areas may require further investigation:

1. Obtaining more information on Mr. McDowall's original plan and strategy.
2. Clarifying the reconnaissance process and who would be involved.
3. Gathering additional details on the Silver officer's role and capabilities.
