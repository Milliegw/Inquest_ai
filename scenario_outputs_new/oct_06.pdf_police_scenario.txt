**Analysis and Potential Counterarguments**

* Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick's testimony provides a clear timeline of her career progression within the Metropolitan Police, which supports the police's version of events.
* Alan's notes provide an additional piece of evidence that may have been written in response to an inquiry concerning Portnall Road on March 14th, 2004. While this note does not directly support the police's version of events, it suggests that there was some level of investigation or inquiry into the matter at that time.
* Potential counterarguments could include questioning the accuracy of Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick's testimony (e.g., whether she accurately recalled her dates of service and roles). Additionally, Alan's notes may not directly support the police's version of events, but they do provide some context about the inquiry concerning Portnall Road.
* To strengthen the police narrative or address weaknesses:
	+ Provide additional evidence to confirm Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick's testimony (e.g., personnel records, official documents).
	+ Clarify the significance and relevance of Alan's notes in relation to the police's version of events.
