RESPONSE:
**Summary of Main Findings**

The proceedings involve the testimony of "Harry" (codename), a former surveillance officer in SO12 Special Branch, regarding events on July 22, 2005. The findings are summarized as follows:

**Key Events**

1. **Briefing at New Scotland Yard**: Harry and his team were called to attend a briefing at New Scotland Yard, given by Mr. Whiddett and an officer referred to as Colin. During this briefing, they were informed about several suspects and shown photographs.
2. **Surveillance Task**: The team was tasked with containing the premises or suspects.

**Key Evidence**

1. **Harry's Statements**: Harry made three statements about the events on July 22, 2005, including a statement written just after the event (July 23).
2. **Surveillance Call Sign**: Harry's call sign ended with "09".
3. **Call Sign Referred to as Hotel 2 or H2**: Harry has been referred to as Hotel 2 or H2.

**Ambiguities and Gaps in Evidence**

1. **Lack of Clarification on "Contain"**: The briefing did not provide clear clarification on what the word "contain" meant, which led Harry to ask for further explanation.
2. **Limited Context for Surveillance Task**: The document does not provide sufficient context or details about the surveillance task or its objectives.

**Recommendations for Further Investigation**

1. **Clarification of Surveillance Task**: To better understand the scope and objectives of the surveillance task, it would be beneficial to gather more information about the suspects, the premises, and the expected outcomes.
2. **Further Clarification on "Contain"**: A deeper exploration of what "contain" meant in the context of the surveillance task could provide valuable insights into the events on July 22, 2005.
