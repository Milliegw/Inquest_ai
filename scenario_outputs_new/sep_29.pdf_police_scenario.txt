RESPONSE:
**Supporting Evidence for the Police's Version of Events**

### 1. Diagram Showing Legal Representatives' Locations

* The diagram shows the location of different legal representatives involved in the case.
* This evidence supports the police's version by providing a visual representation of the parties involved, helping to clarify their roles and relationships.

### 2. Simplified Diagram of the Control Structure

* The simplified diagram illustrates the command structure on September 29, 2008, with Mr. McDowall at the top, followed by Commander Dick (DSO), Silver Commanders for Scotia Road and Portnall Road, and team leaders for surveillance, firearms, and SO13.
* This evidence supports the police's version by providing a detailed overview of the command structure on the day in question.

### Testimony of Mr. Peter Clarke

* Mr. Clarke was an Assistant Commissioner for Specialist Operations at the Metropolitan Police, head of the Anti-Terrorist Branch (SO13) since May 2002.
* He retired from this position earlier that year.
* His testimony provides insight into his role and responsibilities during the relevant time period.

**Potential Counterarguments or Inconsistencies:**

* The police's version may be challenged by the lack of evidence about Bronze commanders, which was acknowledged by Mr. Hough as not being fully understood at this point in the inquiry.
* The simplified diagram of the control structure may raise questions about the complexity and potential omissions in the command structure.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Provide additional context on Bronze commanders:** Offer more information or clarification on the role of Bronze commanders, such as their responsibilities and how they fit into the overall command structure.
2. **Offer a more detailed diagram of the control structure:** Consider providing a more comprehensive diagram that includes all relevant parties and their roles to help clarify any potential confusion or inconsistencies.
3. **Strengthen Mr. Clarke's testimony:** Encourage Mr. Clarke to provide more specific details about his role and responsibilities during the time period in question, as well as any interactions he had with other individuals involved in the case.

By addressing these areas, the police can strengthen their narrative and better support their version of events, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive and transparent inquiry process.
