RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

### Surveillance Video Footage

* The police had surveillance video footage showing Jean Charles de Menezes walking out of the doorway at Scotia Road, boarding a bus, and traveling to Stockwell Station.
* This evidence supports the police's version of events by providing visual confirmation of De Menezes' actions, including his intention to board the underground at Brixton Station.

### Witness Statements

* The police had statements from surveillance officers who watched De Menezes as he walked out of the doorway and boarded the bus.
* These witnesses reported that De Menezes behaved suspiciously, appearing to use anti-surveillance techniques, which raised concerns among the officers directing the operation.

### Commander Dick's Testimony

* Commander Cressida Dick, the officer who took over the conduct of the operation, testified about her decision-making process and communication with other officers.
* She stated that she was informed that specialist firearms officers were not in a position to intervene initially but then learned they were on hand. This led her to countermand the initial order to stop De Menezes and instruct the firearms officers to take action.

### Inconsistencies and Potential Counterarguments

* Some may argue that the surveillance footage could have been edited or manipulated to support the police's narrative.
* The police should be prepared to address these concerns by providing detailed information about their handling of the footage, including any measures taken to ensure its authenticity.

### Recommendations for Strengthening the Police Narrative

* Provide additional detail about the surveillance footage, including timestamps and locations, to further substantiate De Menezes' actions.
* Offer more context about Commander Dick's decision-making process and communication with other officers to clarify her thought process and demonstrate transparency.
* Be prepared to address any concerns or inconsistencies raised by witnesses, experts, or opposing counsel, and provide evidence-based explanations for any discrepancies.
