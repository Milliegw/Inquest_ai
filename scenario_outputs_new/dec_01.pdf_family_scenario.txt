PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative? Provide a detailed analysis of each piece of evidence, identifying potential inconsistencies or contradictions with specific references to the document content. Structure your response with clear headings for each evidence point, include hypothetical examples if direct quotes are unavailable, and conclude with actionable next steps for legal representatives.

* Analysis: The statement appears to be a thorough account of the Metropolitan Police response to the events in question.
* Potential inconsistencies or contradictions:
	+ None found in the provided documents.

**Actionable next steps:** Request additional information from Commander Stewart to clarify any gaps or uncertainties in his initial statement. This could include specific dates, times, and locations related to police actions.

**Evidence Point 2: Juror's Personal Commitment**

* Reference: Document, page 10-12
* Analysis: The juror has a personal commitment that will require travel out of the country, making it unavoidable.
* Potential inconsistencies or contradictions:

These two evidence points do not directly challenge the police narrative, but rather provide context for understanding the events surrounding the case. As the legal representative of the family, it would be important to focus on other evidence that may contradict or undermine the police account.
