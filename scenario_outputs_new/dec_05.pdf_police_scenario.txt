PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events? Provide an in-depth analysis of each supporting piece of evidence, referencing specific document content or quotes where possible. Format the response with clear headings and sub-points for each evidence item, address potential counterarguments or inconsistencies, and conclude with recommendations for strengthening the police narrative or addressing weaknesses.

RESPONSE:
Based on the provided documents, there is no explicit evidence that directly supports the police's version of events in this case. The documents only contain a transcript of a Coroner's court proceeding, where Sir Michael Wright provides instructions to the jury.

However, if we were to analyze the context and tone of Sir Michael Wright's statements, it can be inferred that he is emphasizing the importance of sticking to the questionnaire and not considering external factors or influences. This could potentially imply that any evidence presented by the police was deemed sufficient and reliable for the purposes of the inquest.

It is essential to note that this analysis is highly speculative and should not be taken as a representation of actual evidence supporting the police's version of events.

Recommendations:

* The police should provide more concrete and tangible evidence to support their narrative, rather than relying on implicit suggestions or assumptions.
* They should also consider presenting alternative explanations for the events in question to demonstrate that they have thoroughly explored all possibilities and ruled out other potential scenarios.
* It is crucial to recognize that the Coroner's court proceeding transcript does not provide any concrete evidence supporting the police's version of events. Therefore, it is essential to focus on providing more robust and credible evidence to strengthen their narrative.
