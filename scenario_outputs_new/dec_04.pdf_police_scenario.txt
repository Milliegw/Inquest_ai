RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

### 1. Charlie 2 and Charlie 12 Testimony

* **Description of Jean Charles' jacket**: According to Sir Michael Wright, Charlie 2 and Charlie 12 described Jean Charles' jacket as "bulky" (Paragraph 13).
* **Counterargument**: The family suggests that the officers undertook no threat assessment when they entered the carriage, implying that the description of the jacket may be a fabrication. However, this does not contradict the actual testimony provided by Charlie 2 and Charlie 12.

### 2. Mr Stern's Statement

* **Split-second decision**: Mr. Stern, on behalf of the police, claims that the officers made a split-second assessment in good faith (Paragraph 5).
* **Counterargument**: The family disputes this version, suggesting that the officers' claim was a lie to justify their actions. However, Mr. Stern's statement provides an alternative explanation for the officers' decision-making process.

### Analysis and Recommendations

The police's narrative is supported by the testimony of Charlie 2 and Charlie 12, which describes Jean Charles' jacket as "bulky". This evidence can be used to reinforce the police's claim that they believed Jean Charles posed a threat due to his clothing. However, the family's suggestion that the officers undertook no threat assessment when entering the carriage raises questions about the accuracy of this description.

Mr. Stern's statement provides an alternative explanation for the officers' decision-making process, suggesting that their actions were based on a split-second assessment made in good faith. This can be used to counter the family's claims that the police fabricated the story.

To strengthen the police narrative and address weaknesses:

1. **Clarify the sequence of events**: Providing more detail about what happened before and during the police's encounter with Jean Charles could help clarify their decision-making process.
2. **Address potential inconsistencies**: The police should be prepared to address any inconsistencies or contradictions in their account, such as the correction regarding DCI Purser's location on July 22nd.
3. **Provide additional evidence**: Offering additional evidence to support the police's version of events could help strengthen their narrative and address concerns raised by the family.
