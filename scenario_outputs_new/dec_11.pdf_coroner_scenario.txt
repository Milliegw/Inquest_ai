RESPONSE:
Based on the provided documents, there are no findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making. The documents only contain transcripts of proceedings, including jury deliberations and discussions between the judge (SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT) and parties involved.

Ambiguities or gaps in evidence that could impact the decision-making process:

* None apparent from this document.
* It seems that the court is waiting for the jury to reach a verdict, but there is no information provided about the case itself, including any potential evidence, witnesses, or allegations.

Areas for further investigation:

* The nature of the case being tried (i.e., what are the charges and allegations?)
* The evidence presented in the trial, if any
* Any relevant witness statements or testimony
* The jury's deliberations and eventual verdict, which is not provided in this document.
