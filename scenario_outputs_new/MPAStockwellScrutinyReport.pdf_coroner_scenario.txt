RESPONSE:
**Main Findings Relevant to the Coroner's Decision-Making**

1. **Lack of Definitive Account**: The report highlights that, despite two investigations by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and a criminal trial under health and safety legislation, there are still unanswered questions about what happened on 22 July 2005.

Reference: Paragraph 4

2. **Incomplete Implementation of Recommendations**: While the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) has made substantial progress in implementing IPCC recommendations, the report notes that the program is not yet complete and may require further action after the Coroner's Inquest.

Reference: Paragraphs 6-7

3. **Need for Cultural Shift**: The report emphasizes that a cultural shift among senior ranks within the MPS is necessary to ensure new policies and practices become embedded across the organization.

Reference: Paragraph 7

**Key Evidence and References**

1. The report states that "much of what happened in the hours before the death of Mr de Menezes is in the public domain" (Paragraph 3). This suggests that some evidence is available, but not all questions have been answered.
2. The delay in providing a definitive account of the events leading up to Jean Charles de Menezes' death is noted as impacting negatively on public reassurance and confidence in policing.

Reference: Paragraphs 4-5

**Ambiguities and Gaps in Evidence**

1. **Unanswered Questions**: The report highlights that there are still unanswered questions about what happened on 22 July 2005, which will only be resolved once the Coroner's Inquest starts in September 2008.
2. **Inadequate Implementation of Recommendations**: While progress has been made, it is unclear whether the MPS has fully implemented all IPCC recommendations.

**Suggestions for Further Investigation**

1. Conduct a comprehensive review of the MPS' implementation of IPCC recommendations to ensure that all necessary changes have been made.
2. Investigate the cultural shift needed within the MPS to embed new policies and practices.
3. Consider the impact of delays in providing a definitive account on public reassurance and confidence in policing.

By addressing these findings, ambiguities, and gaps in evidence, the Coroner's decision-making process can benefit from a more comprehensive understanding of the events surrounding Jean Charles de Menezes' death.
