RESPONSE:
**Summary of Main Findings Relevant to Coroner's Decision-Making**

The Metropolitan Police Commissioner's response to the Rule 43 Report highlights several key findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making:

1. **Command Structure**: The report raises concerns about the unclear extent of the Gold Commander's supervision after setting strategy and the Silver Commander's freedom to adjust or refine it.

**Evidence**: Paragraphs 8-9 of the response detail that the MPS is contributing to a revised ACPO Manual of Guidance on the Police Use of Firearms (ACPO Manual 2009) to clarify the continuing role played by the Gold Commander after setting strategy.

2. **Counter-Terrorism Interoperability Project**: The report highlights the need for national consistency in responding to terrorist incidents, including command and control, firearms, surveillance, control rooms, and technical support.

**Evidence**: Paragraphs 5-6 of the response detail that the MPS is leading a national "Counter Terrorism Interoperability Project" to ensure national consistency and disseminate learning throughout the UK.

3. **Internal Reviews and Reports**: The report notes that the MPS has undertaken internal reviews and reports, but some matters remain to be addressed.

**Evidence**: Paragraph 7 of the response references Commander Stewart's statement detailing the many reviews, reports, and subsequent work undertaken by the MPS.

4. **ACPO Manuals Revisions**: The report highlights the need for revisions to ACPO Manuals (e.g., Manual of Guidance on the Police Use of Firearms and Surveillance Manual) to disseminate learning throughout the UK.

**Evidence**: Paragraphs 6-9 of the response detail that the MPS is contributing to revised ACPO Manuals, including the ACPO Manual 2009, to ensure national consistency and clarify the continuing role played by the Gold Commander after setting strategy.

**Ambiguities or Gaps in Evidence**: The report does not provide explicit answers to some concerns raised, such as the extent of the Gold Commander's supervision after setting strategy. Further investigation is needed to address these ambiguities and support informed decision-making.
