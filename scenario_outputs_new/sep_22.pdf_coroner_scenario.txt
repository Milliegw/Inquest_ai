RESPONSE:
**Summary of Main Findings**

The main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

* The jury selection is underway, and 21 potential jurors remain from whom the 11 will be chosen.
* One potential juror had particular difficulties that meant she would not have been able to serve in the conditions of the courtroom, and the coroner has already asked her to stand down.

**Key Evidence**

The key evidence supporting these findings includes:

* The statement by Mr. Hilliard, the legal assistant, that one potential juror had "particular personal difficulties which would have made it very difficult, if not impossible, for her to serve in the conditions which you see in this room" (Paragraph 4).
* The coroner's decision to release the juror from further service and address his remarks to the surviving 21 jurors.
* The mention of the juror having been asked by the coroner's team to stand down over the weekend, as stated by Mr. Hilliard.

**Ambiguities or Gaps in Evidence**

There are no ambiguities or gaps in evidence that could impact the decision-making process at this point. However, further investigation may be necessary to:

* Clarify the nature of the personal difficulties faced by the juror who was asked to stand down.
* Determine whether any other potential jurors have similar difficulties that would affect their ability to serve.

**Conclusion**

Based on the evidence provided, it appears that the coroner has made an informed decision to release one potential juror from further service due to her personal difficulties. Further investigation may be necessary to support this decision and ensure a fair and effective jury selection process.
