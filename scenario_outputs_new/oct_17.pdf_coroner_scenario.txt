RESPONSE:
**Summary of Main Findings**

The main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

### Operation Objectives

* The operation, known as MASTS (Mobile Armed Support to Surveillance), had two objectives:
	+ To arrest and detain any suspect or subject coming from a specific address (21 Scotia Road).
	+ To gather intelligence if possible.

Quote: "The object of the exercise, the MASTS exercise that day, was two-fold... Firstly to arrest and detain any suspect or subject coming from number 21; that's the first object? Secondly, there was another object, which was intelligence gathering if it were possible?" (Paragraphs 16-18)

### Intelligence Gathering

* The objective of intelligence gathering was to gather information without compromising the address.
* The goal was to stop and question individuals who left the address, but not trail them all over London.

Quote: "You don't want to risk compromising the address but you don't want to trail them all over London to find out what they have to say, because then you leave fewer people back at the address if somebody else comes out you want to ask questions of." (Paragraphs 22-24)

### Aspirational Stop

* The witness, Detective Chief Inspector Gregory Purser, envisioned that only one person would need to be stopped and questioned.

Quote: "What I envisaged was that we might only have to stop one person, and if you actually look at it, unfortunate..." (Paragraph 25)

**Ambiguities and Gaps in Evidence**

* The witness's response suggests that the actual outcome of the operation may have deviated from the aspirational stop. Further investigation is needed to determine what actually occurred on the day.
* The document does not provide explicit information on how the intelligence gathering was conducted or what specific measures were taken to prevent compromise of the address.

Recommendations for further investigation:

1. Review security footage and witness statements to understand the actual events that transpired during the operation.
2. Examine the protocols in place for conducting intelligence gathering operations without compromising sensitive locations.
3. Investigate whether any deviations from the aspirational stop occurred, and if so, what factors contributed to these deviations.

By addressing these ambiguities and gaps in evidence, a more comprehensive understanding of the operation can be gained, ultimately informing the coroner's decision-making process.
