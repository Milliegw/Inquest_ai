RESPONSE:
**Main Findings:**

1. **Coroner's Responsibilities:** The coroner (Sir Michael Wright) is responsible for directing the jury on the law and summarizing the evidence.

**Key Evidence:**

2. **Witness Statements:** The witness statements are not available for review, but a complete transcript of the 36 days of evidence will be provided in the room for deliberation.

3. **Reliability of Witnesses:** It is left to the jury's discretion to determine which witnesses they consider honest, accurate, and reliable.

4. **Relevance of Evidence:** The coroner emphasizes that it is up to the jury to decide what evidence is relevant and significant, and not all evidence will be equal in importance.

**Ambiguities and Gaps:**

5. **Unreferenced Evidence:** There may be gaps in evidence that were not referred to during the summing-up process. The coroner encourages the jury to consider all the evidence presented over the 36 days of testimony, even if it was not explicitly mentioned during the summary.

**Recommendations for Further Investigation:**

6. **Review Transcript:** The coroner suggests reviewing the complete transcript of the 36 days of evidence in preparation for deliberation and decision-making.

By following these guidelines, the coroner's office aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the key findings and relevant evidence while also acknowledging the importance of the jury's role in evaluating the facts and making an informed decision.
