RESPONSE:
As an expert legal assistant, I will analyze the provided documents to identify potential evidence points that could be used to challenge the police narrative.

**Evidence Point 1: The Jacket Description**

The document highlights a correction made by Sir Michael Wright regarding the description of Jean Charles' jacket as "bulky." It is suggested that the officers undertook no threat assessment when they entered the carriage, and it is not accepted that there is any question of mistaken perception about the jacket.

Analysis: This evidence point suggests that the police narrative might be inconsistent with the actual events. The correction highlights the possibility that the officers fabricated a reason for shooting Jean Charles, and this could be used to challenge their account.

Next Steps:

* Investigate whether the officers had any prior information or intelligence suggesting that Jean Charles was wearing bulky clothing.
* Examine if there were any witnesses who saw Jean Charles' jacket before the incident.
* Question Sir Michael Wright's correction regarding the description of Jean Charles' jacket and explore potential motives for the police to make this error.

**Evidence Point 2: DCI Purser's Location**

The document reveals that Sir Michael Wright initially stated that DCI Purser was at home on July 22nd, but he later corrected himself, stating that DCI Purser was actually in a nearby hotel.

Analysis: This evidence point suggests that the police narrative might be inaccurate or misleading. The correction highlights the possibility of human error or intentional misdirection by the police.

Next Steps:

* Verify DCI Purser's location on July 22nd and explore any potential reasons for his presence at the hotel.
* Investigate whether this correction has any bearing on the overall investigation and if it could be used to challenge the police narrative.
* Examine Sir Michael Wright's process for verifying the accuracy of information provided by the police.

**Evidence Point 3: The Command Team**

The document highlights that the command team requested corrections regarding Sir Michael Wright's initial statements. This suggests that the police might have been trying to correct their own narrative or cover up certain aspects of the investigation.

Analysis: This evidence point suggests that the police might be attempting to manipulate the narrative or hide information. It could indicate a lack of transparency or honesty in their reporting.

Next Steps:

* Investigate what specific corrections the command team requested and why they were necessary.
* Explore whether these corrections have any bearing on the overall investigation and if they could be used to challenge the police narrative.
* Examine Sir Michael Wright's process for verifying the accuracy of information provided by the police.

**Conclusion**

The evidence points analyzed suggest that there might be inconsistencies or contradictions in the police narrative. The corrections made by Sir Michael Wright regarding DCI Purser's location, the description of Jean Charles' jacket, and the command team's requests highlight potential areas where the police might have been attempting to manipulate the narrative or hide information.

As legal representatives for the family, it is essential to further investigate these evidence points and explore any potential inconsistencies or contradictions. This could involve questioning witnesses, verifying information, and examining the police's process for gathering and reporting data.
