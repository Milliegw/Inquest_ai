RESPONSE:
**Coroner's Decision-Making Findings**

**1. Justification of Shots**

The main issue is whether the officers were justified in shooting Mr. de Menezes. Ms. Leek agrees with Mr. Stern that this central question should be addressed in the verdict (Paragraph 23).

**2. Honest Belief**

Ms. Leek emphasizes that the issue is not the precise sequence of facts and events, but rather whether the officers had an honest belief that their actions were justified (Paragraphs 17-20). This suggests that the coroner should direct the jury to consider this aspect.

**3. Traditional Verdict Forms**

Ms. Leek proposes leaving traditional short-form verdicts (lawful killing and open) intact, as these would still elicit the jury's response on justification (Paragraphs 11-14).

**4. Logical Gap between Lawful and Unlawful Killing**

SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT inquires about a logical gap between lawful and unlawful killing. Ms. Leek acknowledges that this might be considered a grey area, but notes that leaving no evidence of a properly directed jury returning an "unlawful" verdict, it would not be necessary to direct the jury on this point (Paragraphs 8-10).

**5. Need for Jury Response**

Ms. Leek argues that even if lawful killing is not left to the jury, the coroner should still ask the jury to return a verdict setting out their conclusion as to whether the officers were justified in shooting Mr. de Menezes (Paragraphs 9-11).

**6. Drafting of Narrative Verdict Form Questions**

SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT notes that the drafting of narrative verdict form questions may impact the decision-making process.

**Gaps and Areas for Further Investigation:**

* The coroner's approach to addressing the issue of justification in the verdict.
* The need for further clarification on the drafting of narrative verdict form questions.
* Potential ambiguity surrounding the logical gap between lawful and unlawful killing.
