PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative? Provide a detailed analysis of each piece of evidence, identifying potential inconsistencies or contradictions with specific references to the document content. Structure your response with clear headings for each evidence point, include hypothetical examples if direct quotes are unavailable, and conclude with actionable next steps for legal representatives.

RESPONSE:
**Challenge to Police Narrative**

As the family's legal representative, I would focus on the following key pieces of evidence to challenge the police narrative:

### Anonymous Witness Corridor Removal

* The anonymous witness corridor was proposed to be removed, providing an extra three feet per row and allowing for a more efficient use of space.
* This change may have resulted in inconsistent or altered testimony from witnesses who were previously screened off.
* Reference: Document Line 16-20

Potential inconsistency: If the anonymous witnesses' testimony is now compromised due to the removal of the corridor, it could impact the credibility of their accounts.

### Jury Bundle Amendments

* Three amendments were made to the jury bundle, including the deletion of a sheet containing side-by-side photographs (Tab 38, page 50).
* This change may have altered the jurors' understanding of the evidence presented.
* Reference: Document Line 6-8

Potential inconsistency: The removal of this photograph could have influenced the jurors' decisions or interpretations of the evidence.

### Dramatis Personae Amendments

* Two amendments were made to the dramatis personae, including the correction of a sentence describing H1's actions ("Geoff. Followed bus from Brixton to Stockwell").
* This change may have resulted in altered perceptions of key individuals involved in the case.
* Reference: Document Line 15-23

Potential inconsistency: The corrected information could provide new insights or alter the understanding of events, potentially undermining the police narrative.

Actionable Next Steps:

1. Investigate any potential inconsistencies or alterations to witness testimony resulting from the anonymous witness corridor removal.
2. Analyze the impact of the jury bundle amendments on the jurors' decisions and interpretations of evidence.
3. Examine the dramatis personae amendments for any significant changes that may affect the police narrative.

By focusing on these key pieces of evidence, we can challenge the police narrative and uncover potential inconsistencies or contradictions that may support the family's claims.
