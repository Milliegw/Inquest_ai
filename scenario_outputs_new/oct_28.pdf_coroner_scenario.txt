RESPONSE:
**Summary of Main Findings**

The main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

1. **Anonymized Witness Protection**: The court has made an order to protect the anonymity of witnesses, and any attempt to breach this order is considered a contempt of court with serious consequences.
2. **Photography Incident**: An incident occurred outside the Oval where a photographer attempted to take a picture of anonymized witnesses. The police have been informed, and the warning remains in place.

**Key Evidence**

1. **Order for Witness Protection**: Sir Michael Wright emphasized that any attempt to breach the order protecting anonymized witnesses is a contempt of court with serious consequences (Lines 6-19).
2. **Photography Incident Report**: The incident occurred outside the precincts of the court, and the police will not take further action against the cameraman (Lines 3-5).

**Ambiguities or Gaps in Evidence**

1. **Witness Identity**: While the court has made an order to protect anonymized witnesses, their identities are not disclosed in the provided documents.
2. **Motives behind Photography Incident**: The motives of the photographer who attempted to take a picture of anonymized witnesses are unclear.

**Suggestions for Further Investigation**

1. **Investigate Witness Motivations**: To better understand the situation, further investigation into the motivations of the anonymized witnesses and the photographer involved in the incident would be beneficial.
2. **Review Court Order**: A review of the court order protecting anonymized witnesses could provide more insight into the specific measures taken to ensure their anonymity.

By considering these findings, ambiguities, and gaps in evidence, the coroner can make an informed decision while keeping in mind the need for witness protection and the potential consequences of breaching this order.
