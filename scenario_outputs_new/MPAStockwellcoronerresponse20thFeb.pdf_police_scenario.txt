RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

1. **Gold/Silver/Bronze Structure**
	* The Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) acknowledges that this structure is "the most appropriate command and control structure for policing operations" and works best with clear terms of reference and defined roles and responsibilities.
	* The MPA notes that new guidelines on command and control are being frequently tested, indicating a commitment to refining the process.
2. **Silver Tactical Commander**
	* The MPS has introduced the concept of a "Silver Tactical Commander" who will sit alongside the silver commander but have sole responsibility for making critical decisions that may result in death.
	* This role is seen as necessary for accountability and to ensure the highest-ranking officers are held accountable in the aftermath.

**Potential Counterarguments or Inconsistencies**

1. **Slow Progress**
	* The MPA notes that progress on implementing changes has been slow, which could undermine confidence in the police's ability to learn from their mistakes.
2. **National Conflicts**
	* There is a risk that changes made in London may conflict with national arrangements, potentially leading to confusion or inconsistencies.

**Recommendations for Strengthening the Police Narrative**

1. **Transparency and Accountability**
	* The police should continue to prioritize transparency by regularly updating stakeholders on progress and implementing changes.
2. **National Coordination**
	* The MPA should work closely with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to ensure national arrangements are aligned with local efforts, reducing the risk of conflicts or inconsistencies.
3. **Training and Guidance**
	* The police should provide additional training and guidance for officers on the Gold/Silver/Bronze structure and the role of the Silver Tactical Commander to ensure a clear understanding of their responsibilities.

By addressing these weaknesses and strengthening the police narrative, the MPA can help build trust with stakeholders and demonstrate its commitment to learning from mistakes and improving policing operations.
