RESPONSE:
Summary of Main Findings Relevant to Coroner's Decision-Making:

**Command Structure:**

* The Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) acknowledges concerns about the command structure raised by Sir Michael Wright, HM Assistant Deputy Coroner.
* The MPA confirms that some changes have been made in response to previous recommendations, but progress has been slow. (Paragraph 4)
* The Gold/Silver/Bronze structure remains the most appropriate command and control structure for policing operations. (Paragraph 5)

**Progress on Recommendations:**

* The MPA's scrutiny found that action is being taken, but progress has been slower than desired in some areas.
* A full response outlining the progress made against each recommendation will be presented to the strategic operational policing committee in April 2009. (Paragraph 3)

**Key Evidence:**

* The document provides no direct references or quotes from witnesses, but it mentions that new guidelines on command and control are being frequently tested, and a cadre of ACPO officers is being trained to deal with situations where extreme threat is present.

**Ambiguities and Gaps in Evidence:**

* There is a lack of clarity regarding the exact nature of the issues surrounding the "designated senior officer" role (DSO) and how it fits with the standard Gold/Silver/Bronze structure.
* The document does not provide sufficient information on the specifics of the changes made by the MPS or the national arrangements being discussed.

**Areas for Further Investigation:**

* Clarification is needed on the exact nature of the issues surrounding the DSO role and its implications for command structure and decision-making.
* More detailed information is required on the progress made against each recommendation, particularly in areas where slow progress has been noted.
* The document suggests that there may be conflicting national arrangements and local practices; further investigation could help clarify these issues and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the command structure and its implications.
