RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

1. **Statement of Officer A**
	* The officer's statement dated 23 July (page 424) describes his belief that the individual he was about to stop from getting on the tube was a "suicide bomber" (line 6-7).
	* The officer clarifies that this belief was based on previous failed attempts by the same individual, not on any imminent threat on that day.
	* This statement provides evidence of the officer's understanding of the situation and his perception of the individual as a potential suicide bomber.

Potential counterargument: The statement may be seen as biased or incomplete, as it only presents the officer's perspective without providing context from other witnesses or records.

2. **Radio Communication Transcript**
	* The transcript (page 423) shows that Officer A was monitoring radio communications and heard the phrase "SAM" in capital letters.
	* This evidence suggests that Officer A was aware of the situation unfolding on the scene and had access to critical information.

Potential counterargument: The authenticity or accuracy of the transcript may be questioned, as no other witness has confirmed hearing this specific phrase.

Recommendations:

* To strengthen the police narrative:
	+ Provide more context about the radio communication system used by the police and its reliability.
	+ Offer testimony from additional witnesses who were present on the scene to corroborate Officer A's account.
* To address weaknesses:
	+ Address potential concerns around the bias or completeness of Officer A's statement by providing alternative accounts from other witnesses or records.
	+ Consider including expert testimony on suicide bombers and their tactics to further support the officer's understanding of the situation.
