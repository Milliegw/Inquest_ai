PROMPT: What evidence supports the police's version of events? Provide an in-depth analysis of each supporting piece of evidence, referencing specific document content or quotes where possible. Format the response with clear headings and sub-points for each evidence item, address potential counterarguments or inconsistencies, and conclude with recommendations for strengthening the police narrative or addressing weaknesses.

RESPONSE:
**Supporting Evidence for the Police's Version of Events**

The provided documents do not explicitly state specific evidence that supports the police's version of events. However, we can analyze the context and tone of Sir Michael Wright's summing-up to identify potential supporting points.

### 1. Witness Statements (not available)

Sir Michael Wright mentions witness statements, but they are not made available in the provided documents. Therefore, it is difficult to determine if these statements support or contradict the police's version of events.

**Potential Counterargument:** The lack of access to witness statements may lead to concerns about bias or incomplete information.

### 2. Investigation Findings (not explicitly stated)

Sir Michael Wright does not specifically highlight any investigation findings that support the police's account. However, he emphasizes the need for the jury to consider all the evidence presented during the inquest.

**Potential Counterargument:** The absence of explicit findings may lead to questions about the quality or thoroughness of the investigation.

### 3. Law and Procedures (not explicitly stated)

Sir Michael Wright mentions his responsibility to direct the jury on the law, but does not specifically mention any laws or procedures that support the police's version of events.

**Potential Counterargument:** The lack of explicit legal guidance may lead to uncertainty about how to apply relevant laws and procedures in evaluating the evidence.

In conclusion, while there is no explicit supporting evidence for the police's version of events, Sir Michael Wright emphasizes the need for the jury to consider all the evidence presented during the inquest. To strengthen the police narrative or address weaknesses, it would be helpful to:

1. Provide access to witness statements and other relevant documents.
2. Clarify investigation findings and any relevant legal or procedural aspects that support the police's version of events.
3. Ensure the jury has a comprehensive understanding of the laws and procedures applicable to the case.

Recommendations:

1. Request additional information from Sir Michael Wright or the investigative team to better understand the evidence supporting the police's version of events.
2. Consider seeking clarification on any inconsistencies or potential biases in the investigation findings.
3. Review relevant laws and procedures to ensure a comprehensive understanding of their application in this case.
