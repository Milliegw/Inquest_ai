RESPONSE:
**Summary of Main Findings**

The main findings relevant to the coroner's decision-making are:

### Factual Questions

* The factual questions submitted by Mr. Mansfield relate to what happened in the carriage and contributory factors leading up to the incident (Paragraph 4).
* These questions aim to provide a narrative aspect of the inquest, which will be considered by the coroner and the jury.

### Contributory Factors

* The contributory factors are set out as questions over three pages, highlighting failures that occurred before the point in time when the incident took place.
* This evidence is intended to inform the coroner's decision-making and provide a comprehensive understanding of the events leading up to the incident.

**Key Evidence**

The main piece of evidence presented by Mr. Mansfield is the unpaginated document (4 pages) that sets out the factual questions and contributory factors. The document is not yet part of the transcript bundles prepared for the jury, as per the court's instructions.

### Ambiguities or Gaps in Evidence

There are no ambiguities or gaps in evidence reported in this segment of the proceedings. However, it is essential to note that the coroner has instructed that any rulings made during the submissions will not be publicly reported until after verdicts are delivered.

**Suggestions for Further Investigation**

Given the narrative aspect of the inquest and the need to consider contributory factors, further investigation may be necessary to gather more comprehensive information about the events leading up to the incident. The coroner's consideration of these factual questions and contributory factors will likely inform the decision-making process and provide a thorough understanding of the circumstances surrounding the incident.

It is essential to note that the court has made an order under the Contempt of Court Act regarding the reporting of oral submissions, which may impact the public's access to information about the case.
