* **Order under Section 4.2 of the Contempt of Court Act**: The court made an order restricting the publication of submissions, ruling, and any subsequent judgments until the jury returns their verdict.
	+ Reference: [Page 1-2] MR HILLIARD: "If I can spell it out... that the submissions made today and any ruling or rulings resulting from those submissions should not be published until the jury return their verdict..."
* **Juror's Personal Commitment**: A juror has a personal commitment that will require travel out of the country, which may impact the jury's deliberation time.
	+ Reference: [Page 11-15] MR HILLIARD: "There is a juror who has a personal commitment... and I think I am right in saying that the last day that that juror would be available is Wednesday 10th of next week."
* **Request to Juror**: The court will ask the juror to remain at least until the last moment before departing, considering the potential impact on jury deliberation.
	+ Reference: [Page 17-20] SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: "I do not want to lose a juror if I can possibly help it... Does anybody see any difficulties or have any objections to raise to the proposal that the juror should be asked to remain at any rate as long as he can?"
