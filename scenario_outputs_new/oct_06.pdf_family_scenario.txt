PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative? Provide a detailed analysis of each piece of evidence, identifying potential inconsistencies or contradictions with specific references to the document content. Structure your response with clear headings for each evidence point, include hypothetical examples if direct quotes are unavailable, and conclude with actionable next steps for legal representatives.

RESPONSE:
As an expert legal assistant, I have reviewed the provided documents and identified several pieces of evidence that could be used to challenge the police narrative. Here is a detailed analysis of each piece of evidence:

**Evidence 1: Alan's Notes (Page 375)**

* Date: March 14, 2004
* Context: Notes relate to an inquiry concerning Portnall Road at that time
* Challenge: The date of the notes could be disputed as it appears to precede the event in question. This raises questions about the relevance and accuracy of these notes.

**Actionable Next Steps:** Request additional information on the Portnall Road inquiry, including any relevant documents or witness statements, to clarify the context and potential relevance to the current investigation.

**Evidence 2: Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick's Testimony**

* Background: Joined the Metropolitan Police in 1983, rose through the ranks to become a Commander at the time of the event
* Challenge: The timeline of her career progression could be challenged as it appears she was promoted rapidly. This may raise questions about potential biases or conflicts of interest.

**Actionable Next Steps:** Request further information on Cressida Dick's specific roles and responsibilities during her promotion to Commander, including any relevant documents or witness statements, to clarify the nature and scope of her involvement in the investigation.

**Evidence 3: Document Timeline (Milestones)**

* Dates:
	+ Joined the Metropolitan Police: 1983
	+ Probationary officer: West End Central (1984-1986)
	+ Uniformed sergeant: South West London in Battersea and Kingston (1984-1987)
	+ Inspector: Peckham in southeast London (1987-1991)
	+ Chief Inspector: Bramshill Police Staff College (1993-1995)
* Challenge: The rapid promotion of Cressida Dick could be questioned, potentially raising concerns about her credibility and objectivity.

**Actionable Next Steps:** Request further information on the specific duties and responsibilities of each role held by Cressida Dick, including any relevant documents or witness statements, to clarify the nature and scope of her involvement in the investigation.

In conclusion, these evidence points present potential challenges to the police narrative. As a legal representative for the family, I would focus on requesting additional information to clarify the context and relevance of each piece of evidence, as well as challenging the credibility and objectivity of key witnesses like Cressida Dick.
