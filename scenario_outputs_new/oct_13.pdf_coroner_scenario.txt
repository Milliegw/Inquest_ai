RESPONSE:
**Summary of Key Findings**

**Inspection Training**: Detective Inspector Merrick Rose had completed IFCAT (Inspectors Firearms Command Accreditation Training) on July 20, 2004.

**Firearms Operations**: Since completing the training, Rose had Silvered approximately six firearms operations by July 2005.

**Work Schedule**: On July 21, 2005, Rose began work at 7:30 am and did not finish until 1 o'clock in the morning, staying in a nearby hotel anticipating potential long hours and short notice.

**Evidence of Message**: A message, "DI IFCAT, you have just told us about that, 'required to Silver firearms OP asap. Given options requested DI Rose', and then 'warned', looked like "0457" was found on the screen (document: jury bundle, divider 43).

**Ambiguities or Gaps in Evidence**

* The exact date of the longer witness statement is uncertain (July 19th or 20th, 2006).
* The original blue book and form 3605 are not available for reference.
* There is no record of firearms operations kept, making it difficult to determine the accuracy of Rose's estimate.

**Suggested Areas for Further Investigation**

1. Obtain a copy of the longer witness statement and clarify the exact date.
2. Review the original blue book and form 3605 for any relevant information or inconsistencies.
3. Confirm the exact number of firearms operations conducted by Rose between July 2004 and July 2005, if possible.

These findings provide context for Detective Inspector Merrick Rose's training, experience, and work schedule on July 21, 2005, which could be relevant to the coroner's decision-making process. However, the ambiguities and gaps in evidence highlight areas that require further investigation to ensure a thorough understanding of the facts.
