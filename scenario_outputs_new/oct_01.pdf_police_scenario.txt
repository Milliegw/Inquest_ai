RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

1. **Senior Officers' Testimonies**
	* No specific evidence is provided in this document to support the police's version of events through senior officers' testimonies.
2. **Firearms Tactics and Planning**
	* The document mentions that firearms officers were separately represented, indicating their involvement in planning and tactics (lines 18-25).
	* This suggests that the police had a well-planned and executed strategy, but no specific details are provided to support this claim.
3. **Rank and File Officers' Testimonies**
	* The document mentions that C2 and C12 were "front line soldiers" and were not involved in the early stages of the incident (lines 17-18).
	* This implies that lower-ranking officers may have been present at Scotia Road earlier, but no specific evidence is provided to support this claim.
4. **Ms Leek's Expertise**
	* The document mentions that Ms Leek has expertise in dealing with certain aspects of the case (line 24).
	* While this suggests that Ms Leek's testimony could provide valuable insights, no specific details are provided to support her version of events.

**Counterarguments and Inconsistencies**

* The lack of specific evidence supporting the police's version of events leaves room for alternative explanations.
* The mention of C2 and C12 not being involved in the early stages of the incident creates a potential inconsistency with the police's narrative.

**Recommendations**

1. **Provide Specific Evidence**
	* To strengthen the police's narrative, it would be beneficial to provide specific evidence supporting their version of events, such as detailed accounts from senior officers or forensic analysis.
2. **Address Counterarguments and Inconsistencies**
	* The inconsistencies mentioned above should be addressed by providing additional information or clarification to resolve any confusion.
3. **Explore Alternative Explanations**
	* To counter potential alternative explanations, it would be helpful to provide a more detailed account of the police's planning and execution of their strategy.

In conclusion, while some evidence is implied in this document, there is limited specific support for the police's version of events. Addressing inconsistencies, providing additional evidence, and exploring alternative explanations are essential to strengthen the police narrative and build a robust case.
