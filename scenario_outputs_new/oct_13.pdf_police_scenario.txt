RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

### Witness Statement (21 December 2005)

* Detective Inspector Merrick Rose provided a witness statement on 21 December 2005.
* This evidence establishes DI Rose as a credible source and sets the stage for his subsequent testimony.

### Longer Witness Statement (19/20 July 2006)

* DI Rose provided a longer witness statement approximately one year after the initial statement.
* This later statement may have included more detailed information about events surrounding the attempted suicide bombings on 21 July 2005.

### Notes from Blue Book

* DI Rose kept notes in a blue book related to his work as a police officer.
* The existence of these notes supports DI Rose's claim that he was involved in firearms operations during this time period.

### Form 3605 (Armed Operation Record)

* DI Rose maintained records on form 3605, which documents armed operations.
* These records provide objective evidence of the police's involvement in firearms operations and can be used to corroborate DI Rose's testimony.

### Training and Qualifications

* DI Rose completed IFCAT training on 20 July 2004.
* This training qualified him to "Silver" (authorize) firearms operations, which is relevant to his role as a police officer involved in the attempted suicide bombings.

### Estimated Firearms Operations Count

* DI Rose estimated that he had authorized around six firearms operations since completing IFCAT training in 2004.
* While this estimate may not be exact, it provides a rough idea of DI Rose's level of experience and expertise in firearms operations.

### Timeline of Events (21 July 2005)

* DI Rose worked from 7:30 am to 1:00 am on 22 July 2005, including into the early hours of the 22nd.
* This timeline establishes that DI Rose was involved in responding to the attempted suicide bombings and supports his claim that he stayed in a nearby hotel overnight.

### Message from Screen (0457)

* A message on the screen shows a conversation between DI Rose and another officer regarding a firearms operation, with the timestamp "0457".
* This evidence supports DI Rose's testimony about being involved in firearms operations and receiving updates during this time period.

**Recommendations for Strengthening the Police Narrative**

1. Provide more detailed information about the contents of the longer witness statement (19/20 July 2006) to better understand DI Rose's perspective on events.
2. Offer more specific examples or instances where DI Rose used his IFCAT training and qualifications in firearms operations, to further establish his credibility as a police officer.
3. Clarify any inconsistencies or gaps in the timeline of events (21 July 2005) to ensure that the narrative is cohesive and easy to follow.

**Addressing Weaknesses**

1. Address potential counterarguments by providing more context about the IFCAT training program and its relevance to DI Rose's role as a police officer.
2. Consider addressing any inconsistencies in DI Rose's testimony, such as potential discrepancies between his witness statement and later statements or interviews.
