RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

### 1. Pat's Testimony (CODENAME "PAT" Transcript)

#### a) Awareness of Strategy Written on White Board

Pat testifies that they were aware of a strategy written on a white board regarding persons leaving addresses under surveillance. The strategy was attributed to Commander Dick and aimed to assess, stop with suitable precautions, and then arrest or speak to those who left the addresses.

Counterargument: None noted.

Inconsistency: None noted.

Recommendation: Further questioning could focus on Pat's understanding of Commander Dick's role in developing this strategy and how it was implemented.

#### b) Reporting Incidents to SIO

Pat testifies that they understood they would have to report any persons leaving the address to the SIO (Senior Investigating Officer), Mr. Boutcher, who was more accessible at the time.

Counterargument: None noted.

Inconsistency: None noted.

Recommendation: Clarify Pat's understanding of their reporting duties and how this information was shared with Mr. Boutcher or other relevant personnel.

#### c) Lack of Recollection on Overarching Policy

Pat testifies that they have no recollection of an overarching policy to prevent suspects from "running" (leaving the scene).

Counterargument: None noted.

Inconsistency: This testimony contradicts the police's version of events, which suggests a specific strategy was in place. Further investigation may be needed to reconcile this discrepancy.

Recommendation: Conduct further interviews with other witnesses or review documents to determine if any evidence exists to support this policy and clarify Pat's understanding of their role in implementing it.

### 2. Other Documents (Not Provided)

As the provided documents do not include any additional evidence supporting the police's version of events, it is recommended that these transcripts be reviewed in conjunction with other relevant documentation, such as witness statements, police reports, or physical evidence, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the case.

Recommendation: Conduct a thorough review of all available evidence and testimony to strengthen the police narrative and address any inconsistencies.
