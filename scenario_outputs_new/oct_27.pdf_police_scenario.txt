RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

### 1. The Witness's Testimony

* The witness, Mr. Mansfield, describes arriving outside Stockwell station in a car driven slowly to arrive at the scene.
	+ Evidence: "I used those hatch markings as an indication that we had actually parked centrally in the road." (Tab 22, Exhibit 34B)
* He did not hear Jean Charles de Menezes say anything when he got out of his seat.
	+ Evidence: "No, sir." (Q10)
* The witness was unsure about the direction from which other shots were fired.
	+ Evidence: "Impossible to say, sir, I am sorry." (Q19)

### 2. The Police's Preparation

* The police had been monitoring the situation and were prepared to take action if necessary.
	+ Inference: Since the witness drove slowly to arrive at the scene and turned off the blues and twos, it can be inferred that the police were preparing for a potential situation.

### 3. The Bus Incident

* The witness saw a bus approaching or already at the bus stop near NatWest Bank, which he assumed was the correct bus.
	+ Evidence: "I saw the bus at an oblique angle when I first became aware of it... As we got to this position near Stockwell tube station, I couldn't see the bus." (Q10-11)

### 4. The Witness's Mental Approach

* The witness was focused on the situation and prepared for potential action.
	+ Evidence: "Before you get there?" (Q13)
* He recognized that the family of Jean Charles de Menezes wanted to know what happened and why.
	+ Evidence: "I appreciate that, sir." (Q7)

**Analysis and Recommendations**

The evidence supporting the police's version of events is primarily based on the witness's testimony. While some inconsistencies exist, such as the witness being unsure about the direction of other shots, these can be addressed through further questioning or additional evidence.

To strengthen the police narrative:

1. Provide more context about the bus incident: Clarify whether the bus was indeed the correct one and what happened during this encounter.
2. Elaborate on the witness's mental approach: Offer more insight into the witness's thought process before and during the situation to provide a clearer understanding of his actions.
3. Address potential inconsistencies: Investigate any discrepancies in the witness's testimony, such as his uncertainty about other shots or the bus incident, to ensure the police narrative remains coherent.

**Potential Counterarguments**

1. The witness's testimony may be biased due to his emotional involvement with the family of Jean Charles de Menezes.
2. The lack of clarity regarding other shots and the bus incident raises concerns about the accuracy of the police version of events.

**Conclusion**

The evidence supporting the police's version of events is primarily based on the witness's testimony, which can be strengthened by providing more context and addressing potential inconsistencies. While some counterarguments exist, further investigation and clarification are necessary to build a strong narrative for the police.
