PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative? Provide a detailed analysis of each piece of evidence, identifying potential inconsistencies or contradictions with specific references to the document content.

RESPONSE:
As an expert legal assistant representing the family, I would focus on the following evidence points to challenge the police narrative:

**Evidence Point 1: Mark Lewindon's Statement**

* Date of statement: October 31, 2005
* Content: Discussion of meeting with Superintendent Johnston to review and reassure him about intelligence flows (page 67)
* Potential inconsistency/contradiction: The statement mentions a meeting on July 22, 2005, but the questioning by MR HILLIARD in this document only goes up to July 21, 2005. This discrepancy could be used to challenge the police narrative.

**Evidence Point 2: Mark Lewindon's Role and Ranks**

* In 2005, Mark Lewindon was a Detective Chief Inspector in the Special Branch (page 9)
* Acting Superintendent within the Special Branch (page 10)
* Head of C Squad dealing with domestic extremism issues (page 14)
* Potential inconsistency/contradiction: The rank and role of Mark Lewindon could be used to challenge the police narrative if there is any inconsistency between his actual role and the information provided.

**Evidence Point 3: Meeting with Superintendent Johnston**

* Agreed meeting on July 21, 2005, for Superintendent Johnston to explain intelligence processes (page 16)
* Discussion of flow charts and reassurance about intelligence flows (page 11)
* Potential inconsistency/contradiction: The purpose and scope of the meeting could be used to challenge the police narrative if there is any discrepancy between what was discussed and the actual events that transpired.

**Actionable Next Steps for Legal Representatives**

1. Verify the accuracy of Mark Lewindon's statement by comparing it to other evidence and documentation.
2. Investigate further into Mark Lewindon's role and ranks on July 22, 2005, to determine if there were any inconsistencies or contradictions with his actual position.
3. Obtain additional information about the meeting between Mark Lewindon and Superintendent Johnston on July 21, 2005, including any notes, records, or other documentation that may have been kept.

By focusing on these evidence points and potential inconsistencies/contradictions, legal representatives can challenge the police narrative and seek to uncover the truth behind the events of July 22, 2005.
