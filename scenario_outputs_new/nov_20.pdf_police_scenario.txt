**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

**Factual Questions (Paragraph 4)**

* **What happened in the carriage?**: This question is not further elaborated upon, leaving it unclear what specific evidence or information supports the police's version of events.
	+ Counterargument: The lack of detail on this point may lead to skepticism about the accuracy of the police's account.

**Contributory Factors**

* **Failures set out as questions**: These failures are listed over three pages, but the specific evidence or information supporting these claims is not provided.
	+ Potential counterarguments:
		- The absence of concrete evidence may undermine the credibility of the police narrative.
		- Failing to provide specific examples or context may lead to skepticism about the relevance and impact of these failures.
