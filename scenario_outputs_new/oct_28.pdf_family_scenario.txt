PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative? Provide a detailed analysis of each piece of evidence, identifying potential inconsistencies or contradictions with specific references to the document content. Structure your response with clear headings for each evidence point, include hypothetical examples if direct quotes are unavailable, and conclude with actionable next steps for legal representatives.

RESPONSE:
**Evidence 1: The Briefing by Trojan 84**

The briefing given by Trojan 84 on the 22nd, in which he said to trust information coming from room 1600 at New Scotland Yard, is recorded as stating that "you might be asked to do something you had not done before." This could potentially imply that the police were planning to use unconventional tactics.

**Potential inconsistency:** The mention of "unusual tactics" and the possibility of doing something new might raise questions about what exactly was planned. If the police are trying to present a narrative that they followed standard procedures, this briefing could undermine that claim.

**Actionable next step:** As a legal representative for the family, I would request more information about these "unusual tactics" and seek clarification on what specific actions were contemplated. This could potentially lead to further investigation and challenge of the police's narrative.

**Evidence 2: The Anonymized Witness(es)**

The judge warns that any attempt to breach the anonymity of the anonymized witnesses is a contempt of court and may result in serious consequences for the photographer and their editor. Additionally, there is an incident reported at the Oval gates where a photographer allegedly attempted to take a photograph of an anonymized witness or witnesses.

**Potential inconsistency:** The fact that the judge feels compelled to warn the media about attempting to breach the anonymity of the witnesses suggests that there may be more to this story than initially meets the eye. If the police are trying to downplay the significance of these events, this warning could imply a potential cover-up.

**Actionable next step:** As a legal representative for the family, I would seek clarification on the identity and role of the anonymized witnesses in relation to the case. This could potentially lead to further investigation into any alleged wrongdoing or misconduct by the police.

**Evidence 3: The Police's Response**

The judge mentions that the police will put up barriers at the witness entrance gate to prevent photographers from getting too close, and that if anyone attempts to move around the barrier to take a photograph, the police will regard it as a contempt of court. This could be seen as an attempt by the police to exert control over the media's access to information.

**Potential inconsistency:** The fact that the police are taking steps to restrict access to the witness entrance gate might raise questions about what they have to hide. If the family's legal representatives can demonstrate that these restrictions are not justified, it could be used as evidence of a broader attempt by the police to conceal information or manipulate the narrative.

**Actionable next step:** As a legal representative for the family, I would seek clarification on why the police feel the need to restrict access to the witness entrance gate and what specific concerns they have about photographers attempting to take photographs. This could potentially lead to further investigation into any alleged wrongdoing or misconduct by the police.

In conclusion, these pieces of evidence suggest that there may be inconsistencies in the police's narrative, particularly with regards to their actions at the Oval gates and their handling of anonymized witnesses. As a legal representative for the family, my next steps would involve seeking clarification on these points and potentially challenging the police's account through further investigation or legal action.
