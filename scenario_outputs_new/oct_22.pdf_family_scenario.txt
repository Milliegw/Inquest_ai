RESPONSE:
**Evidence Review: Challenging the Police Narrative**

As a legal assistant representing the family, I would focus on the following key pieces of evidence to challenge the police narrative:

### Evidence 1: Witness Statement (2005) - Containment vs Surveillance

The witness, codename "Harry", was instructed to contain the premises or suspects. However, this instruction raises questions about the scope and purpose of the surveillance.

**Challenge:** Did Harry's understanding of "contain" align with the police narrative? Was he simply told to monitor the premises without conducting actual surveillance?

Actionable next step: Request clarification on what the term "contain" meant in the context of the briefing, as well as any follow-up instructions or guidance provided to Harry.

### Evidence 2: Witness Statement (2007) - Health and Safety Trial

Harry gave evidence at the Health and Safety trial on October 12, 2007. This testimony could provide valuable insights into his understanding of the events on July 22, 2005.

**Challenge:** How did Harry's testimony in 2007 differ from or align with his current statement? Are there any inconsistencies that could be exploited?

Actionable next step: Obtain a copy of Harry's testimony from the Health and Safety trial to compare with his current statement. This could help identify any discrepancies or contradictions that could challenge the police narrative.

### Evidence 3: Witness Statement (2008) - Surveillance Team

Harry was part of the grey surveillance team on July 22, 2005. As a member of this team, he may have had access to critical information and observations.

**Challenge:** What specific details did Harry observe during his surveillance activities? Were there any notable events or incidents that could contradict the police narrative?

Actionable next step: Request more detailed information about Harry's observations on July 22, 2005. This could include descriptions of people, locations, and events, which might help disprove or challenge the police account.

### Evidence 4: Witness Statement (2008) - Photo Identification

Harry was shown photographs of suspects during the briefing, including one displayed on screen as tab 37 of the jury bundle.

**Challenge:** Can Harry accurately identify the individuals in these photographs? Are there any inconsistencies between his current statement and any prior statements or testimony?

Actionable next step: Request Harry's opinion on the authenticity of the photographs and whether he recognizes any of the suspects. This could help establish or challenge the identity of individuals involved in the events.

**Conclusion:**

By focusing on these key pieces of evidence, we can begin to challenge the police narrative and potentially uncover inconsistencies or contradictions that might support our clients' claims. It is essential to carefully review each piece of evidence, identify potential weaknesses, and develop a strategy for exploiting them in legal proceedings.
