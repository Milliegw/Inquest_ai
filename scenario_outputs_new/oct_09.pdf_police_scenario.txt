RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

1. **Witness Testimony: Bernard's Statement**
	* Date: July 2005
	* Rank: Detective Constable (SO12 Special Branch)
	* Statements made: Two statements, one in January 2006 and another just a few days ago

This evidence provides firsthand information from an officer who was on duty at New Scotland Yard during the relevant time period. Bernard's testimony can be used to corroborate other witness accounts or establish timelines.

2. **Timeline Discussion**
	* Hough mentions that they are one day behind schedule, aiming to catch up by Friday
	* The plan is to call witnesses Nick, Bernard, Brian, Pat, Mellody, and Rose over the next two days

This evidence provides insight into the investigation's progress and the police's goals for the remaining testimony. It can help establish a sense of urgency or highlight potential delays.

3. **Document Receiving: SO12 Branch Note**
	* Date: October 2008
	* Content: Branch note in relation to Brian

The receipt of this document suggests that the investigation is ongoing, and new information is being uncovered. This could indicate that the police are actively pursuing leads or gathering evidence.

**Potential Counterarguments or Inconsistencies**

1. **Inconsistency in Witness Testimony**
	* Bernard's statement may not be reliable if it contradicts other witness accounts
2. **Limited Information from Documents**
	* The SO12 branch note only provides limited information about Brian, leaving many questions unanswered

**Recommendations for Strengthening the Police Narrative**

1. **Conduct Thorough Investigation**
	* Gather more evidence and testimony to support the police's version of events
2. **Address Inconsistencies in Witness Testimony**
	* Conduct additional interviews or gather corroborating evidence to validate witness accounts
3. **Provide More Information from Documents**
	* Release more details about the SO12 branch note and other documents related to the investigation

By addressing these areas, the police can strengthen their narrative and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the events surrounding the case.
