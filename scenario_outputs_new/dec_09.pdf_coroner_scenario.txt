RESPONSE:
**Coroner's Decision-Making Summary**

**Juror Instructions and Directions**

The coroner, Sir Michael Wright, provided detailed instructions to the jury regarding their deliberations. He emphasized the importance of striving for a unanimous verdict but allowed for majority decisions (10-1 or 9-2) if complete agreement was not possible.

* "You should do your best to be unanimous if you can about the short form verdict... However, if you cannot manage to achieve complete agreement, the time has come when I am now able to accept decisions from you on each of those matters where at least nine of you are agreed." (Paragraph 16)
* "If it is clear to you that that is not possible, then I can accept majority decisions of ten to one or nine to two, as the case may be..." (Paragraph 22)

**Interpretation of Question 4(d)**

The coroner provided guidance on how to interpret question 4(d) regarding the identification of Mr. de Menezes.

* "The general difficulty in providing an identification refers to the difficulty that you may think almost always would exist if you were trying to identify someone whom you did not know and had never seen before." (Paragraph 7)
* "You will appreciate that this was not one of those lifestyle surveillance operations where a subject is kept under surveillance for days or weeks; this was much more limited than that, and you should bear that factor in mind." (Paragraph 13)

**Ambiguities and Gaps in Evidence**

No significant ambiguities or gaps in evidence were identified in the provided documents.

However, it is noted that the jury's deliberations and eventual verdict are not reflected in the documents. Further investigation into their decisions and findings would be necessary to complete the coroner's decision-making process.

**Recommendation for Further Investigation**

To support the coroner's decision-making, further investigation should focus on:

1. The jury's deliberations and final verdict.
2. Any additional evidence or testimony that may have been presented during the trial.
3. Clarification of any ambiguities or gaps in the existing evidence.
