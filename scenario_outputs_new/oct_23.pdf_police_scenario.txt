RESPONSE:
**Evidence Supporting the Police's Version of Events**

### Ivor's Testimony

* **Surveillance Intentions**: Ivor states that his mindset during surveillance was to continue observing Mr. de Menezes without arousing suspicion (Q 11). This indicates a focus on gathering information rather than intervening.
* **Prevention of Detonation**: When asked about wrapping his arms around Mr. de Menezes, Ivor explains he aimed to prevent any detonation or access to weapons (A 18-19). This suggests that his actions were motivated by concern for public safety.
* **Mr. de Menezes' Movement**: Ivor describes Mr. de Menezes as advancing towards him and the firearms officers with a "fast walk" (A 13). This testimony supports the police's assertion that Mr. de Menezes was acting suspiciously.

### Potential Counterarguments:

* Some might argue that Ivor's actions were overly aggressive, implying a lack of professionalism.
	+ Address: While Ivor's methods may seem extreme, his testimony highlights his concerns about public safety and the potential threat posed by Mr. de Menezes.

### Recommendations for Strengthening the Police Narrative:

1. **Emphasize the importance of vigilance**: Highlight the need for police officers to be vigilant in high-stress situations like this one.
2. **Clarify Ivor's training and protocols**: Provide information about Ivor's training and protocols regarding surveillance, self-defense, and de-escalation techniques to demonstrate his professionalism.
3. **Focus on the context of the situation**: Emphasize the chaotic and fast-paced environment of the London Underground, making it challenging for officers to react quickly and effectively.

By addressing these areas, the police can strengthen their narrative and provide a more comprehensive understanding of Ivor's actions during the incident.
