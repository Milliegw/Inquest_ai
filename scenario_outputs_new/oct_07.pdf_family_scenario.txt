PROMPT: If you were representing the family, what evidence would you focus on to challenge the police narrative? Provide a detailed analysis of each piece of evidence, identifying potential inconsistencies or contradictions with specific references to the document content. Structure your response with clear headings for each evidence point, include hypothetical examples if direct quotes are unavailable, and conclude with actionable next steps for legal representatives.

RESPONSE:
As an expert legal assistant, I would focus on the following evidence points to challenge the police narrative:

**Evidence Point 1: Surveillance Log**

* The surveillance log states that JC left the number 2 bus at 9:48 and then caught the same number 2 bus at a stop further down the road at 9:52.
* However, Sir Michael Wright's recollection is that JC got back on the bus at the same stop where it had stopped earlier.
* Inconsistency: The surveillance log contradicts Sir Michael Wright's account of events.

**Actionable Next Step:** Request clarification from the police on this discrepancy and ask them to provide any additional evidence or testimony that may support their original account.

**Evidence Point 2: Mr. Cremin's Log**

* There are two sets of numbers in Mr. Cremin's log, with the higher number being 164.
* The entry "Followed [arrow] surveillance into station, entered tube, sat inside, confronted by SO19 team, shot in head, non-compliant" is marked as coming from SO19.
* Inconsistency: This account contradicts Sir Michael Wright's earlier statement that JC was shot in the head.

**Actionable Next Step:** Request a copy of Mr. Cremin's original log to verify the accuracy of this entry and ask him to clarify any inconsistencies with his previous testimony.

**Evidence Point 3: SO19 Black Team**

* The entry "SO19 black team, could there have been any confusion re: Kratos -- VE 'no'" suggests that SO19 may have had a role in the events surrounding JC's shooting.
* Inconsistency: This entry raises questions about the involvement of SO19 and potential conflicts with other evidence presented.

**Actionable Next Step:** Request further information on the SO19 black team, including their purpose and any relevant testimony or documentation. Additionally, investigate any possible connections between this team and the events surrounding JC's shooting.

By focusing on these evidence points, legal representatives can challenge the police narrative and potentially uncover inconsistencies that may be important in building a case for the family.
