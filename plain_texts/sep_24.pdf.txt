2 (10.00 am)
3 (In the presence of the jury)
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
5 I hope you enjoyed your conducted tour around London
6 yesterday. You remember I asked you that if you had any
7 questions, you should save them up for this morning. Do
8 any of you have any questions you would like to raise
9 about yesterday's trip? No. Fine, thank you very much.
10 Before we start, can I just make one thing clear:
11 I have the power as all counsel know under rule 37 of
12 the Coroners' Rules to direct that the evidence of
13 witnesses who appear to me to give uncontroversial
14 evidence should be read instead of bringing the
15 witnesses into the box to give their evidence orally.
16 I propose to take that course with the evidence of
17 Vivien Menezes, paragraphs 1 to 24, and Patricia Armani
18 de Silva, paragraphs 1 to 20. I am happy to be able to
19 say, Mr Mansfield, I understand that the family are
20 content that I should take that course.
21 MR MANSFIELD: Sir, thank you very much, yes.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well. Mr Hilliard.
23 MR HILLIARD: Sir, the first witness is Stephen Reynolds,
24 please.

1 MR STEPHEN REYNOLDS (sworn)
2 Questions from MR HILLIARD
3 MR HILLIARD: With the Coroner's permission, if you want to,
4 I daresay you may be able to sit down.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I think you may take it that everybody
6 can sit down.
7 MR HILLIARD: Mr Reynolds, as you know, my name is
8 Nicholas Hilliard and I am going to ask you questions
9 first of all on behalf of the Coroner.
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 Q. You have just indicated that you are currently a senior
12 investigator with the Independent Police Complaints
13 Commission; is that right?
14 A. That is correct, yes, sir.
15 Q. Did you begin work with what we will call for short the
16 IPCC on 26 July of 2005?
17 A. That is correct, yes.
18 Q. So very shortly after the events that we are concerned
19 with?
20 A. Yes, that's correct.
21 Q. Just so we have the background, and I do not want to do
22 it in more than summary form, but before that, had you
23 been with Essex Police?
24 A. Yes, I had.
25 Q. Had you retired in the rank of Detective Chief
3
1 Superintendent?
2 A. I did, yes.
3 Q. Had you held that rank for the last five years of
4 31 years' police service?
5 A. That is correct, yes.
6 Q. Then, as we have heard, the Independent Police
7 Complaints Commission began an investigation into the
8 death of Mr de Menezes; is that right?
9 A. That's correct.
10 Q. It follows, does it, that from the time that you joined
11 the IPCC, so 26 July of 2005, and thereafter, you were
12 involved with their investigation?
13 A. I was.
14 Q. Now, after the events at Stockwell tube on 22 July of
15 2005, were efforts made to retrieve any CCTV film that
16 might show relevant events of that day?
17 A. Yes, efforts were made.
18 Q. Did that include film from the bus on which
19 Mr de Menezes had travelled?
20 A. Yes, it did.
21 Q. And that's film, is this right, from the bus's own CCTV
22 system?
23 A. That's correct.
24 Q. We are going to see all this a little bit later this
25 morning, but just so far as that was concerned, is this
4
1 right: it's not a complete picture of film on the bus by
2 any means, because the bus camera system, did it have
3 a fault?
4 A. There was a fault which we found out was caused by
5 excessive vibration.
6 Q. But what we will see some examples of, we have pictures
7 of inside the bus on occasions, and also pictures from
8 a camera that's on the bus pointing out of the bus,
9 ahead I think in most instances?
10 A. That's correct, yes.
11 Q. Right. So we have some film from the bus that we will
12 be looking at. In addition, was film from any cameras
13 on fixed points on the bus route taken possession of?
14 So that's outside the bus.
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. On cameras that we are all familiar with in the street?
17 A. Yes, footage was retrieved from those sources.
18 Q. Then finally, just on this point, was CCTV film taken
19 possession of from Stockwell station itself?
20 A. Yes, in the area of the ticket hall.
21 Q. Right. And the escalators and so on, we are going to
22 look at that.
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. So far as film from the platform that we went down to
25 yesterday is concerned, is the position there that that
5
1 film was not recording, although there was CCTV film
2 there which could be viewed, at the time it was not
3 making a recording?
4 A. That's correct.
5 Q. Then so far as the train's own CCTV is concerned, was
6 the position this: the system had been removed from that
7 particular train in common, I think, with just about
8 every other underground train, after the 7/7 bombings?
9 A. That's correct.
10 Q. Because obviously everybody wanted to look and see what
11 clues there were on underground film in relation to
12 those bombings. Is this right: on this particular
13 train, it had not yet been put back?
14 A. That's correct.
15 Q. All right. We will look at what we have got in a moment
16 or two.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Do we know, Mr Hilliard, why the system
18 on the platform wasn't recording?
19 MR HILLIARD: There was a fault, I think, in the signal; is
20 that right?
21 A. Yes, there was -- it was identified after the incident
22 that there was a cable which linked the recording part
23 of the system which it would appear somebody had trodden
24 on, and we were able to or engineers were able to
25 ascertain that it had not been recording for a few days
6
1 prior to the 22nd.
2 Q. Right. Is this right: film that is relevant to the
3 journey has been put in a presentation side by side with
4 a representation of the route that Mr de Menezes took on
5 22 July?
6 A. Yes, that's correct.
7 Q. So you can see the two of them at the same time?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. As I say, we will look at that in a moment or two. The
10 first thing that we are going to look at are some
11 pictures of the Scotia Road area; you are familiar with
12 those, Mr Reynolds?
13 A. Yes, I am.
14 Q. As you know, it's where we went yesterday. So if we can
15 just go to the second one, and pause everything there.
16 Members of the jury, you have a map of the area, as you
17 know many of them are in the jury bundle, so I will not
18 cross-reference all the time with those; we can spend so
19 long cross-referencing we don't actually look at what we
20 have.
21 Just so that we have our bearings here, Mr Reynolds,
22 just the overview, we will come to the red flashing
23 circles in a moment.
24 Scotia Road is marked here, isn't it?
25 A. It is.
7
1 Q. And 17 Scotia Road, that was the address that
2 Mr de Menezes lived at?
3 A. Yes, he did.
4 Q. 21 Scotia Road in the same block, that was the address
5 that the police had become interested in, we will hear,
6 after the gym card was examined; is that right?
7 A. Yes, that is right.
8 Q. We will hear all about that later. Then we saw
9 yesterday that the way out onto Upper Tulse Hill from
10 Scotia Road is Marnfield Crescent, and that's been
11 marked here, hasn't it?
12 A. It has.
13 Q. Then there are three circles flashing, effectively along
14 Upper Tulse Hill; is that right?
15 A. That's right.
16 Q. We can see that the TA Centre has been marked, which we
17 saw yesterday?
18 A. Yes, it is.
19 Q. Then if you come along Upper Tulse Hill you come to the
20 junction and there is a red flashing circle there too,
21 you come to the junction with Tulse Hill itself, don't
22 you?
23 A. That's right.
24 Q. In due course we will see the journey, won't we, that
25 Mr de Menezes took shown on a presentation and then the
8
1 bus that he got on, going off up Tulse Hill itself.
2 A. Yes, we will.
3 Q. I want to start, please, if we can, at the top right hot
4 spot, if we can click on that, please. I am sure we are
5 now all very familiar with that. The porch we can see,
6 these were obviously taken some time later so the
7 vehicle there is quite irrelevant, isn't it?
8 A. It is irrelevant, yes.
9 Q. The porch that we see, that's the porch that's over the
10 communal door to the flats behind it which include the
11 flats we have just spoken about, 17 and 21; is that
12 right?
13 A. That's right.
14 Q. If you, as it were, go into this photograph, you will
15 come to Marnfield Crescent, won't you?
16 A. Yes, you will.
17 Q. And be able to make your way out. I think there is
18 a facility, will this take us round 360 degrees? If it
19 will, perhaps we will just pan round. (Pause). So we
20 will look at this on some film we will see in a minute.
21 Behind the photographer now are some areas for parking
22 cars, aren't there?
23 A. Yes, there were.
24 Q. And we will look at one particular car that was parked
25 in a moment. All right, so if we can go back to the
9
1 aerial view and then to the second. That's the one.
2 Can you help us about this, Mr Reynolds: if we look
3 here, we can see closest to the photographer there is
4 a lamp post, isn't there?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Is that the area where, on the 22 July of 2005,
7 a surveillance officer who we are calling Frank, is that
8 where he had parked his van?
9 A. Yes, that is where he parked his van.
10 Q. Right. In front of him, if he had got out of his van
11 and walked on, there is a little turning there on the
12 left, isn't there?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Which is called, I think, Leckhampton Place. We may
15 lose the definition when we really zoom in. But anyway,
16 that's the road that we have zoomed into with the road
17 sign.
18 Beyond Leckhampton Place is the block of flats,
19 isn't it?
20 A. Yes, it is.
21 Q. On the right-hand side we can see a little insert of
22 film, can't we?
23 A. Yes, we can.
24 Q. If we look at that, we have a date, 22 July 2005; is
25 that right?
10
1 A. That's right.
2 Q. Then a time, 05.14.01?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. Is what we have there -- and we will press the start
5 button in a moment -- film that was taken by the
6 surveillance officer Frank?
7 A. Yes, it is.
8 Q. He took pictures, is this right, of some of those who
9 left by the communal door of the Scotia Road flats?
10 A. Yes, that's correct.
11 Q. Not of Mr de Menezes; is that right?
12 A. That's right.
13 Q. We will hear from Frank in due course, but is this
14 right: so he explained that he was urinating into
15 a bottle at the time that Mr de Menezes left the block?
16 A. That's correct.
17 Q. Right.
18 Now, so far as the clock is concerned, is this
19 right, that it appears to be about an hour and five
20 minutes slow?
21 A. Approximately, yes.
22 Q. Approximately, absolutely. I think it varies in its
23 slowness, is this right, between about an hour and four
24 minutes slow, and an hour and six minutes, something
25 like that?
11
1 A. I think the difference is explained from the times on
2 the logs with the counter on the video.
3 Q. All right, but if we worked on the basis of
4 approximately an hour and five minutes slow, that's
5 a good working rule, is it?
6 A. Yes, it is.
7 Q. Again, we will hear obviously from Frank, but just to
8 put this into some kind of context while we are looking
9 at it, is this right: according to him, six people came
10 out before Mr de Menezes; is that right?
11 A. That is right.
12 Q. Of whom he filmed five; is that right, as you understand
13 it?
14 A. Yes, that is correct.
15 Q. When we play the start of this film, we will see -- I'll
16 mention them when we see them -- the times I think are
17 6.43, 7.12, 7.21, 7.22, and 7.35. That's the time on
18 the camera. So we have to add an hour and five minutes
19 to each of those.
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Those are obviously all before Mr de Menezes came out at
22 shortly after half past nine in the morning?
23 A. That is so, yes.
24 Q. All right. Just one other thing: the Coroner in his
25 opening to the jury mentioned a black Nissan Primera
12
1 car; do you remember?
2 A. I do.
3 Q. Which was registered to somebody called Abdi Omar; do
4 you remember?
5 A. I do.
6 Q. Who was someone again who the police were interested in,
7 if I put it that way, in connection with the bombings or
8 the attempted bombings?
9 A. Yes, that's correct.
10 Q. We heard about that car being seen in the vicinity of
11 the Scotia Road flats, and when we play this film we
12 will see that the photographer Frank has sort of zoomed
13 in and out a bit, for example he will go on to the
14 Leckhampton Place road sign but I think we will also be
15 able to see two cars in the distance, and it may be up
16 to the back and the right is the Nissan Primera; all
17 right?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. So we will play that, and members of the jury, just so
20 you understand, the faces of individuals -- all they did
21 was happen to walk out of where they lived -- have also
22 been blanked out, so just to explain that's been done.
23 No mystery about that.
24 Can we play that, please.
25 Video footage shown
13
1 Looks like a black car in the distance, on the
2 right, doesn't it?
3 A. Yes, it does.
4 Q. So that's 6.43 according to this clock. 7.12, 7.21,
5 7.22 and 7.35. Those are five people, anyway, before
6 Mr de Menezes had come out that were filmed; is that
7 right?
8 A. That's right.
9 Q. I think what we will then see is after he has come out,
10 and I have explained that he was not filmed, but we will
11 play on so we can see the whole of this video recording.
12 Video footage shown
13 If we can then return, please, to aerial view, and
14 go to the third of the red circles. That's showing us
15 Marnfield Crescent; correct?
16 A. That is correct, yes.
17 Q. If it will do the whole view ... so you walk along that
18 little road, it's now behind the photographer, and then
19 round this bit to the left of Marnfield Crescent to get
20 out into Upper Tulse Hill if you have come from
21 Scotia Road?
22 A. Yes, that's right.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I wonder, Mr Hilliard, if Mr Reynolds
24 could -- I know the jury saw it all yesterday -- just
25 give us a description for the note of the green area to
14
1 the right of the road. What is it, Mr Reynolds?
2 A. I think that's a play area, certainly open space, as
3 part of the Housing Association estate.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, I follow. It's all on the
5 right-hand side of Marnfield Crescent as one walks round
6 it, is it?
7 A. As you walk round to the left, that is on your right.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
9 MR HILLIARD: Can you help, there is a play area in there,
10 we can see railings on the outside, I am sure you are
11 not going to know from your own knowledge unless you
12 happen to live round there, but can you help us: was the
13 set-up the same on 22 July of 2005, as far as you know,
14 or different?
15 A. As far as I know it was the same. This was an issue
16 that cropped up before the trial at the Old Bailey, and
17 we made some enquiries and our enquiries confirmed that
18 there had been no changes.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: No changes since 22 July?
20 A. That was the result of our enquiries, yes.
21 MR HILLIARD: All right. If we can go back to the aerial
22 view, and I don't think the fourth one will help us, so
23 if we can go to that one, please, this is looking back
24 the other way, isn't it?
25 A. Yes, it is.
15
1 Q. So you would have to go into the photograph to turn down
2 that little road and then make a right into Scotia Road?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. Again can we just ... so that is where Marnfield
5 Crescent comes out onto Upper Tulse Hill, isn't it?
6 A. That's correct.
7 Q. All right, we can go to the next hot spot, please. We
8 will go the whole way round.
9 That's showing us, isn't it, on the right there the
10 Territorial Army Centre --
11 A. Yes, it does.
12 Q. -- on Upper Tulse Hill. We can see that's marked just
13 a little way along the road having come out at Marnfield
14 Crescent.
15 If we can go to the last flashing circle, this is
16 showing, isn't it, we can see the junction of
17 Upper Tulse Hill and Tulse Hill itself?
18 A. Yes, that's right.
19 Q. If, as you now look at it, you have come from the left,
20 from Upper Tulse Hill, if you turn here and walk into
21 the photographs towards the roadworks you are on
22 Tulse Hill and there we have zoomed in a bit so you can
23 see the bus shelter and the bus stop in front of it,
24 can't you?
25 A. I can, yes.
16
1 Q. All right. That, I think, is the bus stop at which
2 Mr de Menezes got on the bus; is that right?
3 A. Yes, that's where the number 2 bus stops.
4 Q. If we look along the top of the screen as we have got
5 it, one or two other things that we are going to look at
6 here, but towards the top left, we can see timeline;
7 yes?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. Again, sir, can I say the jury obviously have a timeline
10 of their own in the bundle, but it will make things
11 I think even more complicated if we try and
12 cross-reference it, we will just stick to one at a time.
13 So if we can click on timeline, please, and click
14 thereto, and then if we can just pause straightaway so
15 that we don't start moving.
16 Again, if we just look at this, now everywhere is
17 marked, so 21 Scotia Road, the address the police were
18 interested in, is marked there. JC for Jean Charles
19 de Menezes is marked in that little blue circle and we
20 will see that will move, members of the jury, just to
21 show his route.
22 Frank's position in the van, we looked at the film
23 that he took, is marked there. Marnfield Crescent,
24 Upper Tulse Hill, the TA Centre we have looked at,
25 Tulse Hill itself and then the bus stop too.
17
1 Then along the bottom of the screen, Mr Reynolds, we
2 can see times are running on, and the one that's
3 highlighted at the beginning is 9.34 because that is the
4 time at which Mr de Menezes came out of the communal
5 door at Scotia Road; is that right?
6 A. That's right, yes.
7 Q. We will see, we will follow this, but it will just give
8 us an idea of the time at which what we are looking at
9 is happening; is that right?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. The screen, just so everybody understands, when the
12 minute changes, suppose for example when we go from
13 events at 9.35 rather than 9.34, the screen just goes
14 blank or black, is that right, to show the minute
15 change?
16 A. Yeah, I think there is some sort of flicker anyway.
17 Q. Yes. Just so we know what we are going to see first,
18 Mr de Menezes's route on foot to the bus stop is shown
19 by the moving blue square with his first initials in it;
20 is that right?
21 A. That's correct.
22 Q. Then a moving red rectangle appears which is
23 representing the number 2 bus that he got on?
24 A. That's -- yes, that's right.
25 Q. I just want your help with this: I think right at the
18
1 beginning when we see the bus coming along, it shows as
2 well as Mr de Menezes getting on the bus, Ivor, one of
3 the surveillance officers, getting on as well. That's
4 what's shown on this presentation, isn't it?
5 A. It was shown on the -- yeah, originally it was, yes.
6 Q. I see. Has that now been corrected?
7 A. I believe that it has.
8 Q. All right. Just so we have this in mind, members of the
9 jury, in case you want this at all, if you go to
10 section 11 in your jury bundles just so you can see what
11 you are going to see.
12 Mr Reynolds, do you have a copy there?
13 A. I haven't.
14 Q. I don't know whether we have one we can provide you
15 with. Don't worry, I know you are familiar with what we
16 have. So what we have here are three plans, you have
17 seen these before although you do not have them there
18 now, Mr Reynolds, you know what I am talking about?
19 A. Yes, I do.
20 Q. That shows us that the route, it is marked in it looks
21 like pink from Scotia Road to Tulse Hill, isn't it,
22 first of all?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. And then it's a sort of deeper orange colour, and
25 members of the jury, if you just go up on, it's got
19
1 page 23A written on it, the first plan in divider 11, if
2 you go up right to the top, can you see Morval Road, top
3 middle, and if you come below that Brixton Water Lane.
4 Everybody got that? If you come down just below the
5 "LA", which is the "lane" of Brixton Water Lane, and now
6 the writing's on its side, can you see Brailsford Road?
7
8 It's on Tulse Hill but approximately in the vicinity
9 of Brailsford Road that Ivor, the surveillance officer,
10 got on. You will see a representation when we look at
11 the film of him getting on, but just so that you know.
12 If you turn over to the next page, 23B, still in
13 section 11, you can see that again the route now of the
14 number 2 bus is shown continuing up Effra Road taking
15 that little turn up St Matthew's Road, Brixton Hill,
16 Brixton Road, then going off up to the left, that's
17 Stockwell Road, and then if you turn over to the last
18 page in this section, this is the route we are going to
19 be looking at.
20 Bottom left now, Stockwell Road, highlighted, and
21 then just going in to the South Lambeth Road beyond
22 Stockwell tube which is marked with that black circle
23 into the South Lambeth Road which is where the bus
24 stopped and Mr de Menezes got off.
25 If we can play, please, and there starts the little
20
1 square moving. You see that as we move to 9.36 now so
2 the screen goes blank. (Pause). So there he is at the
3 bus stop, the representation of the number 2 bus coming
4 along. Pause if we can.
5 So just to show that he's got on the bus, members of
6 the jury, his little square will now stay in the red bus
7 for as long as he is on the bus. As you know, we will
8 see him getting off near Brixton tube, we will see some
9 film of that.
10 But what we have on the left are the first of the
11 pictures, is this right, Mr Reynolds, from the bus's own
12 camera system?
13 A. Yes, that's from two of their cameras.
14 Q. Right, and if we can just play on slowly, we will get
15 two more pictures, I think, and I want to just stop
16 there, please. Those may be, it will be a matter for
17 the jury to say, about as good as some of the
18 photographs of Mr de Menezes on the day get; is that
19 right?
20 A. That is probably the best photos, yes.
21 Q. So we can see him from the front top left, get
22 an opportunity to see the jacket he had got on there; is
23 that right?
24 A. That's right, yes.
25 Q. And then a side view, members of the jury, in that
21
1 bottom picture again from the bus's camera system. Can
2 you just help us: where did he go and sit, just roughly,
3 on the bus, downstairs or upstairs?
4 A. He stayed downstairs and went to the rear of the bus and
5 sat on the offside of the bus.
6 Q. On the offside?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. Right. All right, thank you, if we can play on, please.
9 A. Sorry, my mistake, it was the nearside, sorry. It was
10 the nearside.
11 Q. Right. (Pause). Just pause a moment. More stills from
12 the bus but I think not telling us anything but the
13 bottom one, that is looking ahead, isn't it?
14 A. Yes, that's the camera at the front of the bus.
15 Q. So pointing in the direction that the bus is going?
16 A. Yes, that's correct.
17 Q. All right. Thank you, if we play on. (Pause). Pause
18 again. Just more film from the bus, but again it's not
19 really telling us anything, is it, but again the one at
20 the bottom is showing the view out of the front of the
21 bus; correct?
22 A. That's correct.
23 Q. Thank you. (Pause). Just go back a bit. Ivor is now
24 shown, isn't he, as having got on the bus?
25 A. Yes, I think he got on the bus at the bus stop that we
22
1 have just seen.
2 Q. All right, so that explains what's what happened there.
3 Thank you. (Pause). Just pause. Now, we have now got
4 some different kind of film; is that right?
5 A. That's correct.
6 Q. And the camera, this is an outside camera, is this
7 right, a Lambeth Council camera?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. I think we can see Lambeth Council CCTV?
10 A. That's part of their CCTV systems.
11 Q. The film that the camera takes is shown top left, isn't
12 it?
13 A. It is.
14 Q. And the purple triangle on the road, Effra Road as it
15 now is, that shows the sort of range that the camera
16 covers; is that right?
17 A. That's correct, yes.
18 Q. So if we look at that, we can see that if that's right,
19 the bus is about to drive into camera range, because you
20 would see if the bus goes on, it is going to go into
21 purple and purple is the camera's view. So we will
22 actually see, is this right, the very number 2 bus
23 itself from the outside coming into this film we have
24 top left?
25 A. That's correct.
23
1 Q. I think we are also going to see in a moment or two,
2 just so I can say it all now, some film of Ivor, the
3 surveillance officer, on the bus sitting downstairs; is
4 that right?
5 A. Yes, he's sat in the area where people with pushchairs
6 and wheelchairs would sit.
7 Q. Again his face has been obscured for obvious reasons?
8 A. That's correct.
9 Q. Thank you, if we can play, please. There is the bus.
10 Just pause. Can't quite see it now, maybe you can if
11 your eyes are good, but we saw it a minute or two ago.
12 There is the number 2 bus going out of shot and there is
13 Ivor sitting in that area on the bus but his face has
14 been obscured?
15 A. That's correct.
16 Q. Thank you. (Pause). Pause a moment. Just to get our
17 bearings, we looked at it earlier on the maps, turned
18 left at St Matthew's Road?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. That will be coming up?
21 A. That's at the top of the screen, yes.
22 Q. Yes. (Pause). Pause, so we are just getting a bit more
23 film of Ivor at that stage, aren't we?
24 A. Yes, that's correct.
25 Q. All right.
24
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Can I ask, I think I know where it is,
2 but the point on the bus where Ivor is sitting is
3 obviously the offside of the bus.
4 A. Yes.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Right at the front, part way down or
6 near the back?
7 A. I think it's part way down.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Part way down the bus, thank you.
9 (Pause).
10 MR HILLIARD: Just to indicate that the bus was held in
11 traffic; yes?
12 A. That's correct.
13 (Pause).
14 Q. Again we are going to be coming into a view of
15 an outside camera, aren't we?
16 A. Yes, another part of Lambeth Council's CCTV.
17 Q. Pause a minute. So we are getting our bearings, we can
18 see that marked on there is Brixton underground station
19 on the right-hand side of the road; is that correct?
20 A. That's correct.
21 Q. Do you remember that the Coroner again when he opened
22 the case said that it looked as if Mr de Menezes had got
23 off the bus with a view to continuing his journey to
24 work via Brixton underground station; yes?
25 A. Yes.
25
1 Q. But that station, is this right, was shut because of
2 a security alert?
3 A. That's the case, yes.
4 Q. Obviously if he had got off the bus, seen that it was
5 shut, that would explain why he just got back on the
6 bus, because the next station up is Stockwell, isn't it?
7 A. That's correct.
8 Q. So this number 2 bus is going to be coming in, isn't it,
9 and we will see it in a moment, the very number 2 bus is
10 coming into the outside Lambeth Council CCTV camera,
11 isn't it?
12 A. Yes, it's just coming into range.
13 Q. And again perhaps just to indicate in advance what we
14 are going to see, the bus comes into view, superimposed
15 on it, I think at one stage by the person putting the
16 film together, "number 2 bus in green", I think has been
17 written on the back just to identify the bus more
18 clearly; is that right?
19 A. Yes, that's right.
20 Q. Then Mr de Menezes is shown getting off the bus; is that
21 right?
22 A. That's correct.
23 Q. When he can be picked up in the crowd of people who were
24 on the pavement, I don't think we are going to be able
25 to do it with our eyes here but if you have special
26
1 equipment and time on your side, that exercise has been
2 done, and he has been identified?
3 A. Yes, that's right, there are times when he is identified
4 during that passage.
5 Q. Lost for a time but back in the vicinity of the bus
6 again before he gets back on it?
7 A. That's correct.
8 Q. All right. Thank you very much, if we can play on,
9 please. (Pause). Pause. It's the bus at the back,
10 isn't it, we can see the number 2 and as I say someone
11 has put the square sign in green, and then "2" and "bus"
12 on it?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. To the left of that we will see that on occasions
15 I think it's the blue square still with JC on it when
16 someone managed to pick him up in the people there?
17 A. That's correct.
18 Q. Thank you. (Pause). There?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. (Pause). Again?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. (Pause). Just pause a moment. So that's moving back
23 towards the bus, we can see at 9.49 according to the
24 timeline on the bottom?
25 A. That's correct.
27
1 Q. And in a minute, we are going to see some film, is this
2 right, from the bus camera itself showing Mr de Menezes,
3 he's got to the top of the stairs in the bus and he is
4 making his way down the bus, I think, on the top deck
5 this time, but at 9.50 so this is when he is now about
6 to get back on the bus?
7 A. That's right.
8 Q. Thank you. If we can play on, please. (Pause). Pause.
9 So you can just see on the right-hand picture, is this
10 right, where Mr de Menezes has come up the stairs and
11 turned round to his right and there is just the back of
12 his jacket that was caught in the picture; is that
13 right?
14 A. That's the left-hand.
15 Q. I think that's the right-hand as I look at it, and if
16 you go to the left-hand picture, there he is actually
17 walking down towards the back of the bus?
18 A. Yes, sorry.
19 Q. Stairs on the right and him just turning and the one on
20 the left is taken a bit further on, he is now --
21 A. That's correct.
22 Q. Yes. (Pause). Yes, and Ivor, if we can just pause for
23 a moment, has got off the bus at this stage; is that
24 right?
25 A. That's right.
28
1 Q. And he is no longer on the bus and he is not shown, it's
2 just JC shown on the bus?
3 A. Yes, and this time he's sat about four rows behind the
4 stairs on the offside of the bus.
5 Q. I think it may be a little bit further back from that,
6 because we will are going to see some pictures and he
7 can't be seen in them, can he? Is it towards the back
8 of the bus?
9 A. It's certainly towards the back of the bus but --
10 Q. You tell us, if you think you can see him in the
11 pictures?
12 A. No, I am just going on what one of the surveillance
13 officers had described.
14 Q. All right. If we can play, please. (Pause). If we
15 could hold for a moment, we can see the bus is moving
16 off, isn't it?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. And you really can't make out anybody in those pictures,
19 can you?
20 A. You can't, no.
21 Q. All right, thank you. Can we just go back, or even in
22 that one?
23 A. No, I don't believe there is any footage now of him sat
24 in that position.
25 Q. Right. Thank you. (Pause). So on goes the bus, it will
29
1 turn left in a minute into Stockwell Road?
2 A. That's correct.
3 Q. We will see some onboard film from the cameras on the
4 bus, but they don't show anything of significance, so we
5 will just play on through those, the next few. (Pause).
6 The Stockwell Road is now marked so we will see the
7 left turn. (Pause).
8 Just pause there. Look ahead, we can see a bus stop
9 is coming up, and there is a yellow rectangle there with
10 "Lawrence" in it; correct?
11 A. That's correct.
12 Q. Lawrence was another surveillance officer who was
13 waiting at that bus stop to get on the bus; is that
14 right?
15 A. That's right.
16 Q. He did that; is that right?
17 A. Yes, he did.
18 Q. In due course we will see a picture from the bus's
19 onboard camera that shows him getting on, I think.
20 A. I believe that's right, yes.
21 Q. Thank you. (Pause). Just pause. So there we have,
22 bottom left, Lawrence and again his face has been
23 obscured, hasn't it?
24 A. It has.
25 Q. I think these times, efforts have been made to
30
1 synchronise them but we can see the time, just on taking
2 this bit of film, for example, 09.55.58?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. Yes?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. 09.55 on the timeline. So play on, please. (Pause).
7 Again, nothing of relevance for us on the onboard
8 camera?
9 A. No, nothing.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Do we know where Lawrence was sitting?
11 A. Yes, he was sitting about three rows behind
12 Mr de Menezes.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: On the top deck?
14 A. On the top deck.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
16 (Pause).
17 MR HILLIARD: The bus is going to bear right, isn't it, in
18 due course up into the South Lambeth Road where the bus
19 stop is marked.
20 A. That's correct.
21 Q. And you have to walk back down the road, Stockwell tube
22 is just below the bus stop, isn't it, it will come up as
23 marked in a moment?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. But that's what's going to happen, isn't it?
31
1 A. Yes, it is.
2 Q. (Pause). So the station is now marked, isn't it?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. (Pause). If we can just pause there while the bus has,
5 because we have not looked at these.
6 If we can turn perhaps to divider 22, because they
7 may be useful in due course, of our jury files. These
8 were taken very recently, I think you are aware of this,
9 Mr Reynolds, last week or something of that sort, the
10 photographs of the station?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. We can just see as we look at the first one, which
13 bottom left on its side is page 34A, that's showing
14 a recent view into the station at the front, isn't it?
15 A. I believe it is, I haven't actually got a photo in front
16 of me.
17 Q. You haven't, can you just about make that out
18 (indicated)?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. If we turn over to the next picture, 34B, that's again
21 you can see the station on the left. Beyond it, where
22 there is the NatWest Bank on the corner -- oh, there we
23 are, thank you very much.
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. Beyond the corner where the underground sign is, if you
32
1 go to the next corner, that building there is a NatWest
2 Bank, isn't it?
3 A. That's correct.
4 Q. On which, if you are very eagle eyed, you can make out,
5 if you go from the tube towards the bank, there is what
6 looks like a statue or fountain or something; do you see
7 that?
8 A. Yes, I do.
9 Q. Just over to the left of that is mounted on the wall of
10 the NatWest Bank is a security camera. You might just
11 be able to make out what looks like a little white
12 cylinder there, it's not easy.
13 A. I can see it, and I do know of its location.
14 Q. Yes, can we put a cursor on that?
15 (Pause). You are either going to have seen it or
16 you are not, I am afraid. We are going to see some film
17 taken from that camera.
18 A. Yes, we are.
19 Q. That's Binfield Road, isn't it, that road?
20 A. It is.
21 Q. If we turn over to the next picture, 34C, we can see the
22 corner with the bank a bit more clearly; is that right?
23 A. That's right.
24 Q. 34D, looking back along the Stockwell Road but we will
25 not trouble with that one. 34E is more helpful to us at
33
1 the moment. There is the station on the left, bank now
2 obscured by the bus, but the bus is just going to turn
3 round there, and go up -- this is a number 2 bus as it
4 happens -- into South Lambeth Road and stop?
5 A. That's correct.
6 Q. If we go to the next picture, 34F, that's looking the
7 other way, isn't it, the bus is now coming towards
8 rather than going away?
9 A. That's correct.
10 Q. There is that statue on the right. Then if we turn over
11 to picture 34G, now you can actually see, we could have
12 gone, you can see that camera a bit more clearly, can't
13 you, on the NatWest Bank. It looks as if it's coming
14 out of the bottom of a traffic light, isn't it, but it's
15 not?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. There is the bus just pulling into the South
18 Lambeth Road where it's going to stop?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Last picture there, you can make out the bus stop just
21 to the left of a road sign, can't you?
22 A. Yes, you can.
23 Q. All right, thank you very much.
24 If we can then just go back to the route of the bus
25 as we said, it's going to go past the station and then
34
1 park up at the stop in South Lambeth Road. We are 9.58
2 or thereabouts. (Pause).
3 Just pause. So as before, when it was purple,
4 I think, when it was a Lambeth one, this is from the
5 NatWest camera, isn't it, it's showing as a blue
6 triangle the sort of approximate area view of the
7 camera; is that right?
8 A. That's correct.
9 Q. And we can see that shown top right, and we can see from
10 looking at the plan that the bus is going to drive
11 through the area of the camera, isn't it?
12 A. Yeah, in fact I think you can just spot it on the top
13 right-hand corner.
14 Q. We will see it more clearly on its way into South
15 Lambeth Road if we watch there. Thank you. You can see
16 it much more clearly. There it comes. Yes?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. (Pause). There is green number 2 bus someone has just
19 written on top again.
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. (Pause). So the bus, still with Mr de Menezes and
22 Lawrence the surveillance officer, it's making its way,
23 isn't it, towards the bus stop?
24 A. That's right.
25 Q. (Pause). We have some idea of the traffic there, it's
35
1 obviously quite heavy, isn't it?
2 A. It was.
3 Q. Yes. (Pause). Just pause. On the graphic at least
4 Mr de Menezes is shown as off the bus there, isn't he?
5 A. Yes, he is.
6 Q. All right, play on. (Pause). Just pause. Lawrence is
7 now shown, if we look as the graphic, as off the bus,
8 isn't he?
9 A. Yes, he is.
10 Q. Mr de Menezes appears to be moving towards the blue
11 triangle which is part of the area or the area that's
12 being shown in the camera, isn't he?
13 A. He is.
14 Q. The film. All right. (Pause). Pause. Now, what's then
15 shown coming into the film, again face is obscured, but
16 it's Ken, who was a surveillance officer; is that right?
17 A. That's correct.
18 Q. We can see that he is in the blue triangle so he should
19 be in the area of the film that we can see and sure
20 enough he is; is that right?
21 A. That is right.
22 Q. Yes, please, play on. (Pause). Just pause. There is
23 quite a lot going on in a sense to look at from now on,
24 both in terms of what's shown on the graphic and what is
25 shown on the film?
36
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. But we have another camera that's been introduced here;
3 is that right? We can see the purple triangle that is
4 pointing towards Stockwell station; is that right?
5 A. That is right.
6 Q. And we can see that Ivor, a surveillance officer, is now
7 shown in the purple triangle range, and so he should
8 appear, and does appear, in the film from that camera on
9 the right-hand side?
10 A. That's correct.
11 Q. All right. Pause a moment. You have another camera
12 view, it's the pale blue one at the top here and if we
13 go to the screen, we can see "Ken" in a square and "JC"
14 in a square in about that area, can't we?
15 A. Yes, that's right.
16 Q. Right. (Pause). Pause a minute, there was Ken, just
17 coming through that pale blue one; correct?
18 A. That's correct.
19 Q. (Pause). Pause. And then from the back, Mr de Menezes
20 as well?
21 A. That's correct.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's all walking along the wall of
23 the NatWest Bank, isn't it?
24 A. Yes, that's the blue square which depicts the camera
25 from the bank, sir.
37
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: So the two gentlemen we can see
2 standing facing the wall are presumably using the holes
3 in the wall, the cash machines?
4 A. Yes.
5 MR HILLIARD: We have Mr de Menezes as we know making his
6 way to Stockwell station and then three surveillance
7 officers shown at the moment in the area, Lawrence, Ken
8 and Ivor.
9 A. That's correct.
10 Q. Thank you. (Pause). Pause. Another camera to contend
11 with, which is the purple triangle right in front of the
12 station; yes?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Ivor is shown as being within the range of that?
15 A. Yes, he is.
16 Q. And sure enough, there he is, bottom right, with "Ivor"
17 on his back. Mr de Menezes is seen in the vicinity of
18 the bank on the corner of Binfield Road, JC is shown in
19 the blue shaded triangle and then sure enough, there he
20 is on the film from that camera top right; correct?
21 A. That is correct.
22 Q. All right. (Pause). Pause. The station is on the
23 right-hand of the picture, so we have our bearings,
24 bottom right, isn't it?
25 A. Yes, it is.
38
1 Q. You might think that camera was looking the other way
2 and that the narrow end is the way it's looking. In
3 fact, it's looking down with the station on the right,
4 isn't it?
5 A. Yes, it is.
6 Q. Thank you. (Pause). Pause. So Ivor at the bottom, Ken
7 we can see at the top, surveillance officers?
8 A. Yes, that's correct.
9 Q. Yes, please. (Pause). Pause. There is Mr de Menezes,
10 bottom right, going towards the station, now picked up
11 on a different camera?
12 A. Yes, that's right.
13 Q. (Pause). Pause. Now, we have a camera view now, a new
14 one for us, that is looking down the Stockwell Road; is
15 that right?
16 A. That's right.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: In the direction from which the bus had
18 come?
19 A. Yes.
20 MR HILLIARD: In this picture, in due course, do we see
21 footage of the arrival of police firearms officers in
22 cars?
23 A. Yes, we do.
24 Q. Unmarked cars, so we are not expecting to see
25 traditional colours on them or anything of that sort?
39
1 A. No.
2 Q. If we just look at that, we have seen it already
3 I think, but we have some idea of the traffic flow we
4 can see in that picture, can't we?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And does there come a point where the first in the
7 convoy of unmarked police officers containing specialist
8 firearms officers tries to pull out of that queue of
9 traffic and come round it?
10 A. Yes, the video shows that, yes.
11 Q. So we understand, and again I repeat, this is in the
12 timeline, so no-one needs to worry about trying to
13 remember it all, but we have Mr de Menezes, haven't we,
14 Mr Reynolds, at Stockwell station?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Surveillance officers there?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. After his arrival there is the arrival of specialist
19 firearms officers, isn't it?
20 A. That's correct.
21 Q. All right, if we can play on, please. (Pause). Just
22 pause. I may be wrong but is this one of the cars we
23 can see beginning to pull out there?
24 A. That is the lead car in the convoy beginning to make
25 it's manoeuvre.
40
1 Q. Right, can everybody just see that, just beyond the
2 traffic lights? It will probably become a bit clearer
3 if we just play on, thank you. (Pause). There it comes.
4 Yes?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Just pause a moment. So effectively we have now three
7 lanes of traffic but the one on the left as we look is
8 the lead firearms car; is that right?
9 A. That's right.
10 Q. Then we just have, again we can see Lawrence as one of
11 the surveillance officers, in the area of the blue
12 triangle and sure enough we pick him up on the film from
13 that camera?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Play on, please. (Pause). Pause. We have Lawrence now
16 in this purple triangle, appears to be on the graphic at
17 least walking down towards the front of the station and
18 sure enough that's him on the film, isn't it, being
19 picked up?
20 A. That's correct, yes.
21 Q. Thank you. Pause. We are going to see some other
22 names, again no-one needs to try to remember all these,
23 but Malcolm, Geoff and I think Graham is going to come,
24 all surveillance officers; is that right?
25 A. All surveillance officers, yes.
41
1 Q. All right. And then just pause a moment, so we will see
2 Malcolm, Geoff and Graham, so other surveillance
3 officers in the vicinity of Stockwell station, and then
4 we will see a number of letters and names indicating
5 firearms officers, is that right, where they can be
6 seen?
7 A. That's correct.
8 Q. So surveillance officers first, then we will see some
9 firearms officers' designations: C2, C12, C6, C7, D9,
10 Terry, C3, William, and I think another surveillance
11 officer, H11, Hotel 11; is that right?
12 A. That's right, yes.
13 Q. Then D4 and C3 firearms officers, so there will be lots
14 of initials, but they are all written for you elsewhere,
15 flying around. That's the arrival of the firearms
16 officers shown on the film and on the graphic. Please.
17 (Pause). Surveillance officer Geoff going towards the
18 station. (Pause).
19 Surveillance officer Graham. (Pause). Just pause.
20 Just below, that's I think some uniform police officers
21 who just happened to be there, shown on the film; is
22 that right?
23 A. Absolutely, yes.
24 Q. All right. Yes, please. Now pause. So this is the
25 start, members of the jury, of the firearms officers who
42
1 you will see obviously on the graphic, but it's probably
2 as well to watch one or the other, otherwise it's even
3 more confusing. If you concentrate either on the
4 graphic or on the film, you will see these designations
5 arriving. I think with the exception of H11, Hotel 11,
6 I think they are all firearms officers, the new ones
7 that you are going to see. Thank you. (Pause). C7.
8 (Pause). D9 and Terry. (Pause). C5, William. Also
9 H11, so another surveillance officer. (Pause). C3,
10 firearms officer. (Pause). Right, so Mr Reynolds, that
11 shows us the arrival, doesn't it, of a number of
12 individuals at and then making their way into the
13 station?
14 A. Yes, it does.
15 Q. Then you told us that film had also been recovered from
16 inside the station?
17 A. It was.
18 Q. So if we can get back the screen, and if we can go,
19 please, to CCTV on the top, at the top, and then right
20 down the bottom there will be CC3, camera 6 is where
21 I would like to start, please.
22 Can we just pause a moment. Mr Reynolds, you can
23 see what this is, CCTV from the station, it's the
24 entrance hall camera, and it's obviously a view now from
25 inside the station.
43
1 If I can just tell you so you have an idea what's
2 coming, you will see on the film Mr de Menezes is
3 marked, then a number of surveillance officers, Ivor,
4 Ken, Lawrence, Malcolm and Geoff. Then from C2 onwards,
5 I think with the exception -- if I have this right -- of
6 Graham and H11, those are two surveillance officers,
7 otherwise they are all firearms officers and in some of
8 them, it may not be in these pictures, it may be later
9 ones, some of them are wearing those caps with the check
10 round them, and pretty obvious firearms in due course in
11 some of the film we are going to look at.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Mr Hilliard, I heard you asking the
13 LiveNote lady how she was getting on, but just before we
14 enter the station would that be a convenient moment for
15 a break?
16 MR HILLIARD: By all means.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Can I just say something about the
18 breaks? There is a terrible tendency whenever we let
19 anybody get out of the courtroom that they disappear and
20 it takes about half an hour to get them back, and that,
21 I may say, applies to counsel and solicitors with equal
22 force. I make it 25 to, we still do not have a clock,
23 can we all be back, please, ready to go on by five to?
24 That should give you plenty of time.
25 (11.35 am)
44
1 (A short break)
2 (11.55 am)
3 (In the presence of the jury)
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Before you go on, Mr Hilliard, I have
5 a question which I think is fairly easily dealt with.
6 But I just want to talk round it a little bit.
7 Mr Reynolds, when Ivor was on the bus, he was on
8 which floor?
9 A. He was on the lower deck as well.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: And at that time, Mr de Menezes was
11 also on the lower deck?
12 A. That's correct, yes.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Where were they in relation to each
14 other?
15 A. Mr de Menezes was at the extreme rear of the bus, and
16 Ivor was about halfway along.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: On the pull-down seats.
18 A. Yes.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Could you give the jury an estimate of
20 the distance between Ivor and Mr de Menezes?
21 A. I would have trouble doing that, sir, and perhaps when
22 Ivor gives evidence, he may be able to answer.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: We will ask Ivor.
24 Looking at the timeline, Ivor was in the bus in that
25 position relative to Mr de Menezes for about six
45
1 minutes?
2 A. Yes, I believe it would be that sort of --
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Something like that, we can check on
4 the timeline.
5 Lawrence was on the bus; it wasn't Ivor, it was
6 Lawrence who was on the top deck sitting three rows
7 behind Mr de Menezes?
8 A. That's correct.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The specific question is: directly
10 behind or on the other side of the bus? You know what
11 I mean, at an angle.
12 A. I believe it was directly behind.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you very much.
14 MR HILLIARD: Right. So we are on the CCTV from the
15 station, the entrance hall camera, so if we can start
16 that, please. (Pause). Just pause. Mr de Menezes
17 obviously has gone forward and then turned right and
18 that's where I think the free Metro newspapers are,
19 which he picked up one of them; is that right?
20 A. That's correct, yes.
21 Q. All right, so that's in the entrance hall, so it's going
22 towards the ticket barrier, isn't it?
23 A. Towards the ticket barrier and then turning right.
24 Q. Left, I think, but anyway?
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Left, yes.
46
1 A. Left, sorry.
2 MR HILLIARD: (Pause). So these are surveillance officers
3 who are shown, aren't they, on the film too?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. You see Lawrence rather than Geoff, I think, in due
6 course. (Pause). Then we are going to see firearms
7 officers, aren't we?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. Another surveillance officer, Geoff.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Can we pause a moment, Mr Hilliard,
11 before we start going down the escalator or through the
12 barriers anyway.
13 On the two occasions that Mr de Menezes was on the
14 bus, before Brixton station and after Brixton station,
15 was the bus crowded?
16 A. I think it was relatively crowded, I don't think it was
17 like a rush hour but I think there was a significant
18 number of people on the bus.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Significant number of people.
20 A. Yes.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
22 MR HILLIARD: Obviously as you appreciate we are going to
23 hear from the very witnesses themselves about distances
24 and so on. We can get some idea of volume of people
25 when we look at some of the bus film, particularly on
47
1 the top deck. That's probably the best we can do,
2 I suspect, isn't it?
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, it is.
4 MR HILLIARD: All right.
5 That was Geoff, then, we had seen, and as I say, we
6 are going to see firearms officers arriving. (Pause).
7 Go back to the menu, and please next go to CC3, but
8 camera 8, please. (Pause). Pause a minute, so we are
9 the same side of the barrier, aren't we, but we are much
10 closer to the barrier than we were in the ticket hall
11 film?
12 A. That's correct, yes.
13 Q. There is the place you take luggage through if you have
14 got that as well as the ordinary barriers?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Again we will see Mr de Menezes, Ivor, Lawrence,
17 Malcolm, I think Hotel 9 and Geoff, surveillance
18 officers, and then firearms officers for the most part
19 after that, making their way through?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Thank you. Mr de Menezes and Ivor. (Pause). So that's
22 the surveillance officers. Then we will see the
23 firearms officers, won't we, in a minute or two?
24 A. Yes, we will.
25 Q. (Pause).
48
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: This is where the question of vaulting
2 the barriers comes in.
3 MR HILLIARD: We can see for ourselves Mr de Menezes passes
4 through in the usual way, some of the officers have
5 jumped over, as the Coroner has pointed out.
6 A. That's correct, yes.
7 Q. Right if we can then go, please, to CC3, camera 4. So
8 we have now come the other side, haven't we, of the
9 ticket barrier?
10 A. Yes, we have.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Have we gone back in time?
12 MR HILLIARD: Yes, we are going back to the beginning, so we
13 will see here Mr de Menezes come forward, go and get his
14 Metro newspaper, then go through the barrier in the
15 normal way, followed by the surveillance officers, and
16 then we will see the firearms officers coming through
17 too. (Pause). If we can go back to the menu, CC3,
18 camera 7, please. This is now on the way to the
19 escalators, so back, as it were, in time a little at
20 least after you have come through the barriers. So you
21 will come through the barriers and come round here.
22 Here again is Mr de Menezes. Pause here and just go
23 back a shot. There. Just pause there. So we have
24 a view of him, some idea of his clothing, we can see in
25 that picture.
49
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's about the best picture we have
2 had of Mr de Menezes so far.
3 MR HILLIARD: The face perhaps is not as good perhaps as the
4 close-ups on the bus, but in terms of clothing, we have
5 some idea. I think his jacket is available, we will see
6 it in due course.
7 A. It will be, yes.
8 Q. Thank you very much, play on. (Pause). Pause there.
9 Just go back a couple. There, for example, we can see
10 a very obvious firearm being carried, can't we?
11 A. Yes, we can.
12 Q. Yes. (Pause). Then, please, if we can go to CC3,
13 camera 5. We are now going to see the escalator area,
14 and that's moving -- an escalator on the left-hand side
15 going down, isn't it?
16 A. That's right.
17 Q. It's stairs on the right for coming up, isn't it?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. So there is Mr de Menezes going down, Ivor, Ken.
20 (Pause). Malcolm, Lawrence, Geoff. (Pause). People are
21 beginning to look behind themselves, you can see why.
22 (Pause). People coming up this side and indeed I think
23 we can see them starting to come up the down escalator
24 on the other side?
25 A. That's correct, yes.
50
1 Q. Thank you. Then just one last piece of film just for
2 a particular reason, if you go please to Stockwell tube
3 station you see SOCO Scenes of Crime Officer video
4 recording, obviously I am not going to play all of this,
5 just pause a moment.
6 This is a walk through, isn't it, with a camera that
7 was done by a Scenes of Crimes Officer, we will see the
8 time I think on a clock inside the station, 11.57; do
9 you remember that?
10 A. Yes, I do.
11 Q. On the 22nd, I think?
12 A. Yes, it was.
13 Q. We will just see that, we are obviously not going to go
14 on to the train but it will enable us to see the
15 position of the train as it was, so it will not take
16 a moment. If we can now just play this, please, it's
17 obviously all been shut off now. (Pause). There is the
18 newspapers on the right; is that right?
19 A. That's correct.
20 Q. (Pause). Just going to look along the up stairs before
21 we look at the down escalator on the left.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. (Pause). The cameraman is now at the bottom, isn't he?
24 A. That's correct.
25 Q. (Pause). Showing the passage, isn't it, towards the
51
1 train, there is obviously some discarded items left on
2 the ground?
3 A. Yes, there was phones, wallets, luggage left by people
4 making away from the station.
5 Q. That's the way into the station on the left there?
6 A. Yes, that's correct.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The platform.
8 MR HILLIARD: Sorry, the platform.
9 That's a green paramedics bag I think on the ground,
10 isn't it?
11 A. Yes, I believe it is.
12 Q. Pause there, please. That's the train in the station,
13 isn't it, which would have been going out, as it were,
14 to the left of the picture as we look?
15 A. That's correct.
16 Q. I am just doing this so we can see where those open
17 doors are there in relation to that entrance on to the
18 platform?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Yes, thank you, we will not need to see any more of
21 that, so we can stop that there.
22 Then Mr Reynolds, just finally this: obviously what
23 you are attempting to do or we have attempted to do with
24 this exercise is just to provide an overview, isn't it,
25 as you appreciate individual witnesses will come and
52
1 give the details of all of this?
2 A. That's correct.
3 Q. And in this exercise you are largely dependent, is this
4 right, upon the accounts of others?
5 A. Yes, we are.
6 Q. Which in due course those others will be giving
7 evidence?
8 A. That's entirely correct, yes, sir.
9 Q. Again so far as the times on this are concerned, I think
10 an amount of work, a large amount of work, has been done
11 in trying to synchronise times from different cameras
12 with different times on them, different people's notes
13 of times and so on, to try to get one accurate timeline,
14 it's probably impossible to do, isn't it?
15 A. Absolutely, because there is a range of different
16 opinions as to what the time was.
17 Q. Again, this is a guide, isn't it, and in addition
18 I think you know, and I have referred to it, in
19 divider 1 of the jury bundle we have, as you know, got
20 a timeline, and with, so far as I am aware, one
21 exception, I am not going to spell it out because there
22 will probably be more, I think there is one error I'm
23 aware of. Those I think are agreed times so far as
24 that's possible, so if there is any difference between
25 that and the presentation, the timeline in the bundle is
53
1 probably the one to go with, isn't it?
2 A. That's correct, yes.
3 MR HILLIARD: Thank you very much indeed.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, Mr Mansfield.
5 Questions from MR MANSFIELD
6 MR MANSFIELD: Sir, would it be appropriate at least in the
7 early stages for counsel to identify themselves?
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That would be very helpful.
9 I am Michael Mansfield and I represent the
10 de Menezes family who are here today.
11 Mr Reynolds, not very much but I want to go back to
12 the beginning, if we may?
13 A. Yes, sir.
14 Q. I will take it slowly as one is getting used to the
15 facilities. If the jury would be kind enough to turn to
16 the timeline, it's divider 1 in the bundle, you will see
17 several entries down on the left, half a dozen, the time
18 6.04 is in there, and that is the time approximately
19 when the surveillance team that are known as the red
20 team arrive in the Scotia Road area; in other words,
21 it's therefore from then on there is a filming facility
22 and there is an observation post and so on.
23 Now, I want to just, keeping that page open for the
24 moment, some time after 6.04, is this right,
25 Mr Reynolds, going back to the black car, the Primera
54
1 Nissan, was spotted by a surveillance officer parked
2 opposite the front door?
3 A. That is correct, yes, sir.
4 Q. I am only putting an approximate time because times may
5 vary, but approximately 6.20, an officer called Tango 3,
6 he is also called Edward -- what he will be called here
7 we will await, one of those two one presumes -- saw the
8 car.
9 I want to, so the jury -- because it's all been
10 happening very recently, if we could go to, and I have
11 asked, sir, for the operator very kindly to go back,
12 I don't need it on the aerial photograph, to the first
13 hot spot, and then if it could kindly revolve so we can
14 see what's behind the camera, as it were.
15 Now, as we go round, I'll ask it to stop now,
16 please. I don't know whether you can help, but we saw
17 a black car in the distance on Frank's film which, as
18 far as I recall, was roughly in the position of the
19 distant car which is now going to be the -- if the
20 cursor could go on it, that one, yes. Was that the
21 place, as you understood it, that the black Nissan was
22 parked?
23 A. That's my understanding now. When we did the
24 investigation, I think all the surveillance officers
25 just referred to it as the vicinity of 21 Scotia Road,
55
1 having looked at the video again in preparation for
2 today I did note that that position which is identified
3 is where I now believe it to have been.
4 Q. So if, recalling yesterday, somebody were to come out of
5 the front door -- I don't ask to revolve back -- you
6 just turn slightly to your left and go back up to that
7 parking space; that's where it would be?
8 A. It would be, yes.
9 Q. So it would take you less than a minute to get that
10 distance.
11 I want to just travel with the car, and I can do it
12 without the aid of the photographs, if we turn to
13 divider 11, if the jury do this, please, divider 11,
14 I think you can help with this: that if a car were to
15 leave that parking space, there is in fact for the car
16 only one way out of Scotia Road if it's wanting to get
17 to the main roads, I am leaving aside the smaller little
18 roads that go into cul-de-sacs on the estate; do you
19 follow?
20 A. I do, yes.
21 Q. If you come out of Scotia Road?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. When you get to the next Crescent, Marnfield, which we
24 went round yesterday, you have to turn left as you come
25 out of the Scotia Road?
56
1 A. Yes, that's correct.
2 Q. And then you get on to Upper Tulse Hill where of course
3 you can either turn left or right to go to whichever
4 main road you really want to go to?
5 A. That's correct.
6 Q. Right, now, that's in terms of if you are coming out in
7 a car. Now, in terms of walking from the front door, if
8 the jury kindly turn to divider number 4, that gives
9 a shot back towards the front door with somebody walking
10 towards what I am going to call the next hot spot, which
11 is just where you come into Marnfield Crescent, please.
12 I think there is a hot spot where you come into the
13 Crescent from Scotia Road. Yes, there, that's right.
14 Now, that's a shot looking at the road to the left
15 as you come out of Scotia Road, that's the route the car
16 would have to take; is that right?
17 A. That's correct.
18 Q. If we could pan to the right, please, just slightly,
19 pause, thank you very much. Right opposite, if you are
20 on foot, of course you can follow the route that the car
21 uses, but if you wanted to go to a bus stop, you could
22 go straight across the play area and the path is marked
23 just in front there; is that right?
24 A. That's right.
25 Q. If it could pan to the right again, if you walk up that
57
1 road there, I don't know how much further the panning
2 goes up the road but in the distance beyond that dark
3 car, there is another path that leads across the grassed
4 play area?
5 A. That's correct.
6 Q. That also comes out, none of this is actually marked on
7 a plan, but going back to the plan on divider 11, you
8 can see roughly where all those three exits come out
9 onto Upper Tulse Hill?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. We can see on the plan, divider 11, and yesterday we
12 didn't go particularly down this road, opposite there is
13 in fact Roupell Road, I am looking at the plan for the
14 moment, not the actual photographs, divider 11, there is
15 a plan, and we can see there that's the route marked
16 that obviously Mr de Menezes followed. You see
17 Roupell Road opposite?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. From Roupell Road you can in fact see the exit that has
20 crossed the Crescent onto Tulse Hill, two of them in
21 fact, in the entrance to the road as well.
22 A. I would think so, looking at the map, yes.
23 Q. Can we go to the next hot spot, please, because I think
24 it's the one -- yes -- which, there is the bus -- that's
25 the bus stop. It's not the one he went to, but it is
58
1 another access to public transport and that's the
2 closest bus stop to Scotia Road, isn't it?
3 A. That is correct, yes.
4 Q. Just beyond the bus stand or shelter, sorry, there is
5 the path that comes across the middle from the Crescent;
6 is that right?
7 A. That's right.
8 Q. So in fact, if someone was walking and wanted to go to
9 that bus stop, they just come out of Scotia Road,
10 straight up the path opposite and come out at that bus
11 stop?
12 A. Correct.
13 Q. Then there is a bus stop, the same bus route on the
14 other side of the road, I don't think it's shown?
15 A. You could actually see it just then.
16 Q. There it is, and Roupell Road is just a bit further up
17 on the left. Now, as far as the walking times are
18 concerned, I am only going to put to you so we have the
19 context approximately, Mr de Menezes himself, and if we
20 turn over on the timeline, sorry it's back to the
21 different divider or on screen if you wish, divider 1,
22 page 3, it's clear that Mr de Menezes took, in fact,
23 somewhere between five or six minutes to get to the
24 number 2 bus stop. You see that at the top of page 3,
25 do you see that?
59
1 A. Yes, I do.
2 Q. In fact, I think one of you actually did the walk as
3 well at some point?
4 A. A colleague of mine, yes.
5 Q. It's roughly that space of time?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. Plainly to get to the closer bus stop, we are talking
8 far less a period, possibly three minutes, to get to the
9 other one we have just seen?
10 A. Yes, I would estimate that, yes.
11 MR MANSFIELD: Thank you very much indeed.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, who's next, yes, Mr Gibbs?
13 MR GIBBS: Sir, I think in the order of questioning it falls
14 to me next, I hope you can hear me from the back.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I can.
16 MR GIBBS: My name is Patrick Gibbs and I represent the
17 specialist surveillance officers. I will not ask this
18 witness any questions at all, I will let the specialist
19 officers speak for themselves about their specialism
20 when they come to give evidence, if I may, and direct
21 surveillance questions at that stage.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you very much. Mr Stern?
23 MR STERN: Sir, I represent the firearms officers C2 and
24 C12. I have no questions, thank you.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
60
1 MS LEEK: Sir, I have no questions.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
3 MR PERRY: Sir, I do have a few questions of Mr Reynolds.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
5 Questions from MR PERRY
6 MR PERRY: I wonder if the ladies and gentlemen of the jury
7 could take the jury bundle, please, and just go to
8 divider 2. I hope you can hear me.
9 I am just going to indicate the people I represent
10 by reference to this document so that it's easier for
11 you to remember. If you look at page 3 of the list of
12 relevant people, which is page 6 using the page numbers
13 in the bottom right-hand corner, I hope you can see on
14 the left-hand side the second entry
15 "Commander McDowell". He is someone I represent. As
16 too is Detective Chief Superintendent Greg Purser on
17 that same page.
18 Then just going through to page 11, using the page
19 numbers in the bottom right-hand corner, Chief
20 Inspector Esposito, Trojan 80. Going on to page 13,
21 Commander Cressida Dick.
22 So, ladies and gentlemen, my name is David Perry,
23 and those are the people I represent. Don't worry too
24 much because it's going to become very, very clear as we
25 go on, you are going to hear an awful lot about them but
61
1 that's just by way of introduction, just trying to help.
2 Mr Reynolds, may I just ask you just some very short
3 points, please, using the jury bundle again and going to
4 divider 11, I just want to ask you, please, about two
5 locations that we will come to hear about in due course,
6 and I just want to orientate ourselves with them using
7 you, if I may, Mr Reynolds, to assist.
8 If we go to divider 11, page 23C, which is the A to
9 Z plan which shows Stockwell tube station towards the
10 left-hand side, South Lambeth Road, Kennington Road and
11 we have seen the number 2 bus as it came up into
12 Stockwell tube station.
13 I just want to ask about two locations. First of
14 all, and perhaps we can use the cursor on the screen as
15 well, just to the right of Stockwell tube station and
16 just down a bit, can we see Blair House? It's just to
17 the right of the "O" in Stockwell. The cursor comes
18 across from Stockwell tube station -- sorry, Stockwell
19 in Stockwell Road. There it is. You have just got it.
20 A. Yes, I can see that.
21 Q. That's Blair House. Just so we know, it was later
22 discovered that a premises within Blair House had been
23 one of the addresses at which one of those who tried to
24 set off an explosive device on 21 July had actually been
25 staying?
62
1 A. I believe I learned that at the Health and Safety trial,
2 I didn't know that before.
3 Q. This is just trying to assist us with some of the
4 locations and without going into too much detail. But
5 the other address that I just want to ask you about, if
6 we carry on down the South Lambeth Road, which is the
7 main arterial route from Stockwell, as everyone probably
8 knows, up to Vauxhall, and just by the B of Lambeth in
9 South Lambeth Road and off to the right, we see, I hope
10 everyone can see and again using the cursor,
11 Dorset Road. Thank you very much.
12 Dorset Road, that was another location at which
13 there was a premises about which we will hear in due
14 course called Corfe House and that too was also linked
15 to the rucksack that had been found at the
16 Shepherd's Bush attempted bomb site?
17 A. Yes, sir, I was aware of that.
18 Q. Now, if we just put this in context, we saw on the film
19 the number 2 bus comes up from Brixton, it turns across
20 the A3 as we see which is Kennington Road on this map,
21 and it moves into the South Lambeth Road, and if we had
22 followed it on its journey, it carries on down the
23 South Lambeth Road, so it passes very close to
24 Dorset Road?
25 A. That's correct, sir.
63
1 Q. Yes, thank you.
2 Mr Reynolds, that's all I am going to ask you about
3 that, so we don't need to get into any more detail on
4 the locations but I just want to ask you one other piece
5 of information if I may, just to have it recorded at
6 this stage.
7 On 21 July 2005, that is the day before the incident
8 with which we are principally concerned, we know that
9 there were the attempted explosions in London, the
10 attempt to detonate explosive devices at the Oval,
11 Warren Street, and Shepherd's Bush, the tube stations,
12 and also the attempt to detonate a bomb on a bus in
13 Hackney.
14 A. Yes, sir.
15 Q. I just want to ask you one thing about that: it
16 transpired, didn't it, that three of the individuals who
17 had attempted to detonate explosive devices had entered
18 the transport system at Stockwell tube station?
19 A. That's as I understand it, yes.
20 Q. And it was in fact known, before the events with which
21 we are concerned, from CCTV cameras that had been
22 recovered from the station, that that was in fact the
23 case?
24 A. Yes, as I said, that's as I understand it, yes, sir.
25 Q. Or at least in the case of one of them?
64
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Sorry, Mr Perry, at what point was that
2 known?
3 MR PERRY: During the night of the 21st and the 22nd, camera
4 footage had been recovered, and some of it had shown
5 footage at Stockwell tube station, and there was a link
6 with some of the other footage, at least from the Oval
7 attempted detonation, to show that at least one of the
8 would-be bombers had entered the transport system at
9 Stockwell.
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 Q. Finally, Mr Reynolds, just this: we saw, when we were
12 watching the screen and the film at Stockwell tube
13 station, the two uniformed police officers who appear to
14 be speaking to a young female at the front of the
15 station. You were asked some questions about those.
16 I just want to clarify something. They were on duty at
17 the station on security patrol at the time, because
18 there was a heightened police presence on the 22nd
19 because of the events of the previous day?
20 A. That's correct, yes.
21 Q. I think, you may not be able to assist with this,
22 Mr Reynolds, in fact there was concern at about
23 10 o'clock at the station when a report was received
24 about possible suspicious packages?
25 A. I can't remember that, but --
65
1 MR PERRY: We have further information and we can go into
2 that to the extent that it's relevant, but Mr Reynolds
3 thank you very much indeed, I am very grateful.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you, Mr Perry. Mr Horwell.
5 MR HORWELL: Sir, my name is Richard Horwell and I appear on
6 behalf of the Commissioner of the Metropolis, I have no
7 questions of this witness.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you. Mr King. Let me repair
9 an unforgivable omission that I made on the first day,
10 I omitted to introduce you, so perhaps you would care to
11 introduce yourself.
12 Questions from MR KING
13 MR KING: Yes, I am Simon King and I represent the
14 Independent Police Complaints Commission, sir.
15 Can I deal with one matter, please, Mr Reynolds?
16 I wonder if we could have page 23C up on the screen? We
17 had it a moment ago. This is from the jury bundle. Do
18 you have that picture on the screen, Mr Reynolds?
19 A. I have the map, yes.
20 Q. The red markings which we understand show the route of
21 the number 2 bus, we can see heading off to the right up
22 the Kennington Road, the A3 on the shot on the screen.
23 Is that in fact the correct depiction of the route
24 for the number 2 bus?
25 A. No, it isn't, it should actually be showing what is
66
1 almost straight on along the South Lambeth Road.
2 Q. When a few moments ago Mr Perry was asking you questions
3 which took the bus on up the South Lambeth Road and near
4 to Dorset Road, for example, he had it right, did he?
5 A. He had it right, the graphic is incorrect.
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I think in fact, Mr King, the jury's
7 copies of the plan have been corrected.
8 MR HILLIARD: We have all got the right ones, the screen has
9 not caught up with us.
10 MR KING: I thought that might be the case but I thought it
11 best to clarify that the screen is incorrect at the
12 moment.
13 Thank you, Mr Reynolds.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Mr Hilliard?
15 MR HILLIARD: Unless you have any questions, sir.
16 Questions from THE CORONER
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: This is probably to satisfy the jury's
18 curiosity.
19 I don't know that it will take us very much further.
20 I don't know whether you can answer these questions,
21 Mr Reynolds, if you can't, you will say so, but from the
22 course of your investigations have you been able to
23 establish whether either Osman or Omar were in fact in
24 21 Scotia Road on the night of the 21st/22nd?
25 A. I don't think I'm the best person to ask that.
67
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You don't know. Very well, we will ask
2 somebody else.
3 MR HILLIARD: Thank you.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you very much.
5 (The witness withdrew)
6 MR HILLIARD: Sir, the next witness is Alex Pereira, please.
7 MR ALEX ALVES PEREIRA (sworn)
8 Questions from MR HILLIARD
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you. Would you like to sit down,
10 Mr Pereira. Yes, Mr Hilliard.
11 MR HILLIARD: Is your name Alex Pereira?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Mr Pereira, can you start by telling us what your
14 relationship was to Jean Charles de Menezes?
15 A. My mother is his -- she is his first cousin, his father
16 is my mother's uncle.
17 Q. I am going to go into his upbringing and time you had
18 spent together over the years in a moment, but is this
19 right in summary: he was just five months younger than
20 you?
21 A. Yeah.
22 Q. Do I have that right?
23 A. Yeah, I was.
24 Q. How old are you now?
25 A. Thirty-one.
68
1 Q. He was five months younger than you. I think you had
2 both lived in your early years, we will go into the
3 detail in a minute, but in the same part of Brazil; is
4 that right?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Then in due course, I'll ask you again about this, he
7 had come to London, hadn't he?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. In July of 2005, were you living in London as well?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Right. I'll ask you about how all that came about in
12 a moment. Before we go into the details, can you just
13 start, it's probably a difficult question, by just
14 telling us what sort of a person Jean Charles was? What
15 was he like?
16 A. He was a guy who liked to learn a lot and he want to
17 fight to make life better because he came from a place
18 where everything is very difficult, it has become better
19 now but at the time it was very, very poor. Since was
20 a little boy he start to, he became an electrician, when
21 he was ten years old because he like electronics,
22 microwaves, something like that, and for us at that time
23 we had no electricity. Everything was very difficult.
24 And he was very interested for that, and he is dream
25 about the United States and England, and I just quite
69
1 knew that in a place like this it could bring back
2 a better life for everybody, for his family and for
3 himself and for everybody around him.
4 Q. All right. So I think you were born and brought up
5 first of all in the southeast of Brazil; is that right?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. Did Jean Charles's family live a very short distance,
8 couple of hundred metres or so from your family?
9 A. Yes, yes.
10 Q. Did the two of you go to the local school together?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. I have the benefit of a statement you made, so that's
13 how I can ask you this question, I think that was ten
14 minutes' walk or so from your home; is that right?
15 A. Yes, yes.
16 Q. Then you told us just now that even as a child he was
17 always keen to be an electrician?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. You describe in your statement how he used to play as
20 a child, trying to make lights from batteries?
21 A. Yes, yes, we got to arrange battery that people throw
22 away and make lights and buy little bulb like this and
23 make some lights.
24 Q. You said that at that time, there was in fact no
25 electricity in your village and that that only arrived
70
1 about ten years or so ago?
2 A. Yes, it was about ten years ago.
3 Q. I think you both stayed on at school until you were
4 about 14?
5 A. Yes, 13 to 14.
6 Q. He went to Sao Paulo for a few years; is that right?
7 A. Yeah, I think that age of 14 he went to Belo Horizonte
8 and then came back in the age of 16 he moved to
9 Sao Paulo.
10 Q. What was he doing there?
11 A. He work in, I think, the place where they grow chicken
12 at that time, he went to Sao Paulo -- not Sao Paulo the
13 capital, Sao Paulo State -- about 280 kilometres from
14 Sao Paulo, and then moved back to Minais Gerais to
15 finish his high school.
16 Q. Then I think you explained that he was thinking of
17 leaving Brazil for a time and contemplated perhaps the
18 United States or perhaps this country; is that right?
19 A. This kind of dream is everybody's dream in that place,
20 but before it was very difficult to make, to raise the
21 money to go, so lots of things you can plan a month or
22 a day, years to plan, and I think it was always his plan
23 but took many years to come to here, so before tried
24 America, when got the money, but they refused him
25 a visa.
71
1 He went back 15 days later and asked what was the
2 reason, because they refuse him a visa and they said no,
3 I won't give you a reason. They he said no, I will go
4 back to London, I don't care about America. About
5 a month later he came to me and said let me go in, my
6 girlfriend has a brother who lives there, he will help
7 me there, and then he decided that we all help him could
8 come here.
9 Q. He had been very keen to come to England for some time
10 but it was a plan that took some time for him actually
11 to make it happen?
12 A. Yeah, because in Brazil what I say about takes long
13 because it costs around ú800. To raise that money takes
14 time because you have a lot of bills like everybody
15 here. So the money you save to make this amount of
16 money in Brazil takes a long time.
17 Q. You say in your statement that he came to the
18 United Kingdom in 2002?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And that you joined him about six months or so --
21 A. Six months.
22 Q. -- after that. Is this right: when you first came
23 here, you moved into a flat, in fact not far from
24 Scotia Road with him?
25 A. Yes, when I go to Scotia Road, you will leave
72
1 Tulse Hill, so up Tulse Hill, this flat it was on the
2 left right in front of the pub(?) Tulse Hill.
3 Q. Was that with Jean Charles and some other Brazilian
4 friends?
5 A. Yes, one friend.
6 Q. He, is this right, was working as an electrician and
7 studying English?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. Did he send money on occasions back to Brazil to help
10 support his family?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. And the girlfriend he had there?
13 A. Yes, his parents, brother, and the girlfriend.
14 Q. Was her name Adriana?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. And I think she had a little child from another
17 relationship; is that right?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. Mr Pereira, I think he stayed in London first of all for
20 something like nine months before the end of 2002 going
21 back to Brazil?
22 A. I think he flew to Brazil the night of 2002 to 2003.
23 Q. So New Year's Eve, New Years Day, that kind of time?
24 A. Yeah.
25 Q. Did he then come back to London with Adriana, his
73
1 girlfriend, for a little time?
2 A. No, he came alone and she joined him around two or three
3 months later.
4 Q. After a time, I think she went back to Brazil because
5 her mother was looking after the child?
6 A. Yes, yes.
7 Q. And not long after she had gone back to Brazil to look
8 after the child, did Jean Charles go back to Brazil to
9 be with her?
10 A. Yes, about a month later.
11 Q. Right. Then I think he came back to London in about
12 April 2005?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Then you say in your witness statement this, that he
15 studied hard and learned English quickly?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. He was prepared to do any work initially, but was
18 pleased when he found work as an electrician, he was
19 very ambitious and worked very hard, but he also enjoyed
20 life?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. You say that he was very happy in England, and you
23 thought that he would like to have settled here
24 permanently eventually?
25 A. Yes, yes.
74
1 Q. Then just two matters, you may have heard mention of it
2 already, but I just want to ask you about, so far as
3 cocaine is concerned, is this right, you weren't aware
4 before his death that he had tried it and you were quite
5 sure that he was not a regular user of it?
6 A. A friend of mine was told me about, but I said: oh my
7 God, it's very strange, I am very embarrassed, we don't
8 talk about that any more. And after he died, when they
9 came with this, I spoke to my boss and they said: Jean
10 would never buy or never bring anything like that with
11 him, and I think my boss was telling the truth.
12 Q. I am really only asking just to clear it out of the way,
13 I am sure you understand, so don't trouble about that.
14 The second matter, if you can just help us with
15 this: you say in your statement that you don't think
16 that he would have had any reason to have feared the
17 police on 22 July 2005, and you explain that you knew,
18 in connection with things like riding his motorbike and
19 so on, that he had been stopped by the police three or
20 four times in this country?
21 A. Yeah, his motorbike twice and off of the motorbike once.
22 Q. No-one is suggesting there is anything untoward or bad
23 about it, it happens to loads of people, but what was
24 his reaction to it, do you know?
25 A. I said was normal. First time was plainclothes police
75
1 and Park Lane, Mayfair, and he said got the answer all
2 the questions, and they gave him some advice and let him
3 go.
4 Q. You say in your statement that he had been stopped when
5 he was driving down Park Lane, spoke to the police
6 officers, and he told you that they were very polite?
7 A. Yes, yes.
8 Q. He mentioned another occasion when he had been stopped
9 and searched and had his correspondence checked by the
10 police?
11 A. Yeah, as one month the officer was searching his bag,
12 another one was asking him questions, and all the
13 questions he answered, connected some letter he did not
14 think it was in his bag, but it was there.
15 Q. You explain in your statement that he said that the
16 police were being very reasonable and that he certainly
17 wasn't worried or scared of them for any reason at all?
18 A. No, because we come from Brazil and very common for
19 police to stop people there, and even police carry a gun
20 in Brazil, it doesn't scare us, so why would he be
21 scared of the police without guns?
22 MR HILLIARD: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Pereira, thank
23 you.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
25 MR MANSFIELD: No questions.
76
1 MR GIBBS: No questions.
2 MR STERN: No questions.
3 MS LEEK: No questions.
4 MR PERRY: No questions.
5 MR HORWELL: No questions.
6 MR KING: No questions.
7 MR HILLIARD: No questions, thank you very much indeed.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That might be a convenient moment.
9 MR HILLIARD: Yes, certainly.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Would this be a convenient moment to
11 deal with the question about any sensitive questions of
12 Commander McDowell?
13 MR HILLIARD: I think that might be when Commander McDowell
14 can hear it.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well. 2 o'clock, please, ladies
16 and gentlemen.
17 (12.56 pm)
18 (The short adjournment)
19 (2.00 pm)
20 (In the presence of the jury)
21 MR HILLIARD: The next witness, sir, is going to come via
22 a videolink. Can we just keep that off the screen for
23 the moment, we wanted to make sure the connection was
24 there.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I didn't think I was going to be the
77
1 next witness.
2 MR HILLIARD: We are releasing you before we are going to
3 see him.
4 Mr McDowall, we will come to you in a minute, if you
5 don't mind, I am just going to read two statements which
6 were left over from this morning which will just fit in
7 from where we were. Is that all right?
8 A. Absolutely, yes.
9 MR HILLIARD: We will just take everybody off the screen for
10 a moment.
11 A. Thank you, sir.
12 MR HILLIARD: Members of the jury, you may remember that the
13 Coroner indicated this morning that he was minded to
14 have two statements read that looked to him as if they
15 were not controversial and, sure enough, they are agreed
16 so I am going to read those to you now.
17 Statement of PATRICIA DE SILVA ARMANI (read)
18 MR HILLIARD: The first is the statement of Patricia Armani
19 De Silva, and she says this:
20 "I was born in Sao Paulo. I am the first cousin of
21 Jean Charles de Menezes. My mother is the sister of
22 Jean Charles's father. Jean Charles was born and grew
23 up in Gonzaga, a small town in remote hills in Brazil.
24 From early childhood, we always visited Gonzaga for our
25 holidays and spent at least a month each year during
78
1 school holidays there.
2 "Jean Charles was three and a half years younger
3 than me, but we were always very close, even as
4 children, and played and fought together.
5 "When Jean Charles was about 16, he came to
6 Sao Paulo and stayed for about a year in our house. He
7 found employment and trained to be an electrician. Then
8 he returned to Gonzaga to complete his high school
9 before returning to Sao Paulo.
10 "He and I had discussed possibly setting up
11 a business together, we thought we might open a shop
12 dealing with electronics and telephones. I would run
13 the shop and he would do the repairs. This never came
14 to fruition.
15 "He started talking about going to the United States
16 when he was about 22. Going to the US was a common
17 dream for many young Brazilians, it was an opportunity
18 to earn a good living but it was difficult to get to
19 America. Many people tried to go illegally, crossing
20 through the border at Mexico. Jean Charles didn't want
21 to do it, he wanted to try and get there legally. He
22 applied for a visa at the US Consulate in Sao Paulo in
23 2001 but was refused and it was after this that he
24 started thinking about going to the United Kingdom
25 instead. At the time, 2002, you didn't need a visa from
79
1 Brazil to get into England, you could enter as
2 a tourist. His intention was to come to London to see
3 if he liked it and if he did, he would apply for
4 a student visa to stay longer.
5 "2 March 2002 I met him at our mutual grandfather's
6 funeral. He told me that he was going to London in two
7 weeks' time. I was surprised. He said 'As soon as
8 I get settled in London I would like you to join me'.
9 I had always dreamt of coming to Europe, and so
10 I started to save money. He travelled to the
11 United Kingdom for the first time on 13 March 2002. We
12 remained in regular contact, he phoned at least once
13 a fortnight, and kept saying 'You must come and join
14 me'.
15 "When he first arrived in London he found it quite
16 difficult, particularly as he didn't have very good
17 English. Then he started studying and as he learnt more
18 English, he became more enthusiastic. He had
19 a girlfriend in Sao Paulo, Adriana. He used to call her
20 every day. He also tried to persuade her to join him in
21 the United Kingdom. She had a little girl from her
22 first marriage. She was a little older than him. He
23 was very keen on her and I think he wanted to marry her
24 eventually. In August 2003 she went to London to join
25 him and stayed for some months. She eventually returned
80
1 because of her daughter, who at that time was being
2 looked after by her mother.
3 "Eventually, I saved enough money and came to London
4 to join Jean, arriving on 25 June 2004. He collected me
5 from the airport and brought me back to his flat in
6 Scotia Road, Brixton, where he was living with two
7 friends who were sharing the flat. When I first arrived
8 in London he was working as an electrician in North
9 London. It was casual work on different projects,
10 sometimes just for the odd day, sometimes for
11 a few weeks or even months.
12 "By that time, he had stopped attending college or
13 school but was studying English at home. He had worked
14 very hard and was able to send money home to his parents
15 as well as working hard he also liked to party, even
16 when he was tired. Often it was round to friends'
17 houses and sometimes clubs. Most of his social circle
18 were Brazilian, but he had other friends too. I suspect
19 he had the occasional girlfriend but he didn't bring any
20 back home.
21 "When he returned to the United Kingdom in
22 April 2005, he brought our cousin Vivien with him. She
23 moved into the flat and the two girls who had been
24 staying there moved out. We lived at number
25 17 Scotia Road which was a part of a block of about
81
1 eight flats, two on each floor. We were on the first
2 floor.
3 "I believe 21 Scotia Road was the flat above us. On
4 one occasion I spoke to somebody who lived in that flat
5 when a parcel was left. It was a man but it certainly
6 wasn't either of the bombing suspects we have seen in
7 the photographs. I have never seen either of those two
8 men in the flats.
9 "When Jean returned to the United Kingdom, he had no
10 work, but a friend of ours at the time was about to go
11 to Brazil for several weeks, and asked if Jean wanted to
12 take over his job whilst he was away. This involved
13 washing dishes in a restaurant in the West End working
14 evenings. He did this job and also got occasional bits
15 of casual work as an electrician. Towards the end of
16 this period, shortly before he died, he was getting more
17 and more work during the day, although continuing to
18 cover for his friend. He was getting quite tired and
19 was really looking forward to his friend's return.
20 "I used to see Jean most days. Usually I saw him at
21 home in the afternoon and the occasional evening when he
22 had the day off. I would be working and studying from
23 the early morning. The last time I saw him was on
24 Wednesday, 20 July at around lunchtime at home. I had
25 returned from college, and he told me about a new
82
1 project he was about to start which would last for about
2 six months. He was very excited about it. It involved
3 doing the electrical work for a block of offices, it was
4 a great opportunity. Then he had left, leaving some
5 money for the rent which I was to give to the landlord.
6 That evening I didn't stay at home but overnight at
7 a friend's house.
8 "The following day Jean called me to check how I was
9 after the attempted bombings on 21 July. We spoke over
10 the phone and he told me to be careful. That was the
11 last time I spoke to him.
12 "On the morning of 22 July I left home at about 5.50
13 to go to Bromley, where I had a cleaning job.
14 Everything seemed to be as normal when I left the flat.
15 I remember in the afternoon I heard news about
16 a terrorist being shot on the tube. I actually met up
17 with my cousin Alex and I remember we talked about the
18 shooting but never connected it to Jean. That night
19 I went to work in Charing Cross and I arrived late as
20 the traffic was diverted because of Stockwell tube being
21 closed. On my return home, there was a diversion on the
22 bus route. I remember being quite surprised that
23 Stockwell tube was closed all day long.
24 On Friday evening, Vivien asked me if I had heard
25 from Jean and I reminded her that he had swapped his
83
1 evening off so he would be at the restaurant. I didn't
2 hear him come back that evening and in the morning
3 I went to work as usual.
4 Later that day, when I returned home, I was on the
5 phone to a friend. Vivien seemed to be quite nervous
6 and I saw that Jean Charles's bedroom was the same as it
7 had been the day before. I realised something bad had
8 happened and then I saw Gesio and Valentine. Gesio
9 explained that the police had been round and we all
10 thought that Jean might be in police custody. Gesio
11 mentioned the police had asked if Jean had anything to
12 do with Al Qaeda. We all thought that was completely
13 crazy and laughable. We all had to go to the police
14 station in Brixton, joined by Alex and Alessandra.
15 I remember we were all sitting in a small room with a
16 long table. Everyone was waiting. I felt really angry
17 with Jean, I thought he had done something really bad,
18 I didn't know what had happened. I thought he was in
19 police custody and didn't realise it was connected with
20 the Stockwell shooting.
21 "We had to wait until everybody had arrived before
22 they would tell us what happened. Gesio, the guy Jean
23 worked with, was sitting next to me. When the police
24 were speaking I couldn't understand a lot of what was
25 being said and then I heard a police officer say that he
84
1 was dead. Gesio had to explain to me and said he had
2 been killed, he had been confused with a terrorist.
3 Then I made the connection with the news. My head
4 started spinning and my stomach was turning. Later we
5 had to go and see his body in the mortuary, the news
6 hadn't really sunk in, when I saw his body, I fainted.
7 "The following days were horrific, we were staying
8 at a hotel in Kingston, arranged for by the police.
9 I spent three completely sleepless nights. There were
10 large numbers of news crews around and the story was
11 constantly on the news.
12 "I am sure that Jean Charles had nothing to fear
13 from the police on 22 July, and there was no reason at
14 all why he would have behaved in a way that would have
15 aroused suspicion. He had been stopped by the police
16 a few times in England. In fact, he used to praise the
17 British police. He mentioned they were always polite
18 and did a good job, particularly in comparison with the
19 Brazilian police. He also remarked on how good it was
20 that they didn't carry weapons on them. I remember him
21 also commenting about seeing other people being stopped
22 by the police and getting angry. He was surprised that
23 the police didn't react because in Brazil people would
24 have been locked up straightaway.
25 "I am sure he had nothing to fear from the police.
85
1 He had never actually discussed his immigration status
2 with me, but I assumed that it was regular. He
3 certainly never expressed any anxiety about it, if there
4 was something out of order I never heard any comments
5 from him.
6 "I was very surprised to learn that he had some
7 cocaine in his bloodstream as I wasn't aware that he had
8 ever taken drugs, although he may not have told me
9 everything. He liked the occasional beer but that was
10 it."
11 She says that she believes the facts stated in that
12 statement I have read are true and that's dated
13 21 January of this year.
14 Next, the statement of Vivien Menezes.
15 Statement of VIVIEN MENEZES (read)
16 MR HILLIARD: She says:
17 "I was born in Sao Paulo but grew up from the age of
18 four or five in the municipality of Gonzaga. From the
19 age of 11, we moved into Gonzaga town. I am
20 Jean Charles's first cousin. I was not particularly
21 close to him as a child, I was quite a lot younger than
22 him, but I knew him very well and saw him often as I was
23 growing up.
24 "He left Gonzaga at the age of about 16 to go to
25 Sao Paulo, and initially started doing some training to
86
1 become an electrician. He also studied English. He
2 returned at about the age of 19 to complete his high
3 school as they were offering an intensive course and he
4 had not completed high school, so he decided to do that
5 so he could get the qualification.
6 "It was at this time that he came back and stayed at
7 my family's house rather than going back to his parents,
8 who lived further out of town. He stayed with us for
9 about a year and a half before he went back to Sao Paulo
10 and it was at that time that I got to know him quite
11 well and we became close.
12 "Jean Charles was an adventurer who always wanted to
13 push himself. He first thought about going to the
14 United States. A lot of Brazilians from our village
15 were trying to get to America, and we heard how good
16 things were there. When he couldn't manage to travel to
17 America, he decided he would try London instead. He
18 loved languages, and really wanted to go abroad, he
19 wanted something different. Life in Gonzaga was quite
20 boring and he wanted new experiences.
21 "When he came back to Gonzaga after he had spent
22 a couple of years in London, he talked very positively
23 about his experiences there. He said there were lots of
24 opportunities for people who had the will to succeed or
25 who were ambitious. There were obviously difficulties
87
1 in relation to immigration and language problems, but he
2 said that if you are prepared to push yourself, there
3 was a lot to be gained.
4 "I was at this time about 20 or 21 and feeling
5 fairly disappointed about my life in Gonzaga. There
6 really weren't any opportunities to develop or go
7 anywhere. Shortly before Jean was due to return to
8 London, he persuaded me to join him. He told me it
9 would give me more opportunities in life and I suddenly
10 had to make a decision within ten days to travel to
11 London. I was only 21 and it seemed like such
12 an opportunity, probably not something I would have done
13 without Jean Charles's persuasion. He helped me
14 purchase tickets and get a passport. His return flight
15 to London had been booked for 6 April, but because he
16 was encouraging me to join him in London and it took
17 longer to make all the necessary arrangements for my
18 travelling with him, he gave up the return flight and
19 booked new tickets to travel via Paris.
20 "I left Gonzaga on 9 April 2005, and travelled to
21 Sao Paulo with Jean Charles. Jean had to arrange
22 everything for me for the trip but he really looked
23 after me. We took a flight to Paris and stayed for
24 about a day and a half and he took me to the
25 Eiffel Tower and other sites. Then we flew to Dublin
88
1 and stayed a day and a night before taking a ferry to
2 England. He showed me a letter that said he had
3 residency in the UK which I understood was together with
4 his passport .
5 "When we arrived in the UK they gave us both visa
6 stamps in our passports saying we could stay for three
7 months. Jean went through passport control first, then
8 he told them that I was his cousin and would be staying
9 with him.
10 "23 April we arrived in London and went to the flat
11 in Scotia Road where Patricia was staying. Two female
12 friends of Jean's were living at the flat, he had
13 arranged from them to stay there so they could pay the
14 rent whilst he was away.
15 "The flat itself was in a small block and had
16 a common entrance with intercom. I didn't really know
17 any of the other people who lived in the block and
18 having seen the photographs of Osman Hussain following
19 Jean Charles' death, I certainly never saw him in the
20 block. If Jean had returned to London on 6 April as
21 originally planned he, would have had some work waiting
22 for him but he lost that job because of his late
23 arrival. So when he got back to London, he just took up
24 bits and pieces of casual work.
25 "A friend who was going back to Brazil asked him if
89
1 he could take over his job washing dishes in
2 a restaurant. The job involved working evenings.
3 Jean Charles kept up this job right up until just before
4 he died and also did bits and pieces of casual work as
5 an electrician. He continued studying English at home,
6 he really loved English grammar and often used to talk
7 to himself in English when he was in the bathroom.
8 "Our lives as immigrants in the UK were not easy.
9 It's a struggle because you need to work hard to study
10 and earn a living, and save money to send back home.
11 However, some aspects of life here are much better.
12 "Most of us come to the UK with the intention of
13 studying English, staying for as long as we are able to,
14 earning enough money to survive and send a little back
15 home. Others just want to try to enjoy the city life.
16 I think Jean wanted both. He wanted to earn money and
17 educate himself further but he also wanted to have
18 a good time.
19 "I was not aware that Jean had ever taken drugs. If
20 he took cocaine, I am fairly certain it was only
21 occasionally, perhaps something he experimented with
22 once or twice.
23 The last time I saw Jean was on the evening of
24 20 July. He told me that he had just been given
25 a really good job; it was an opportunity to do all the
90
1 electrical work in a block of flats and he would
2 probably have up to six months' work. He was very
3 excited about the new opportunity. He told me that the
4 work was for a friend called Gesio. Jean was very happy
5 and we had a really deep conversation about life. Jean
6 talked about how he was nearly 28-year old, and needed
7 to think about the future.
8 "The next day, Thursday 21 July, was the day when
9 there were the four attempted explosions. Jean
10 telephoned me at about 1.30 and told me he was on his
11 way to meet Gesio in North London. He phoned to check
12 that I was okay. We were all feeling a little bit shaky
13 after the 7 July bombings. After the second lot of
14 attempted bombings on the 21st, I felt quite scared. It
15 was feeling as though London was beginning to become
16 a dangerous place to live and I was wondering whether we
17 should leave. Jean said: we need to pray and hope not
18 to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. That was in
19 fact the last conversation I had with him. He went to
20 work at the restaurant on the evening of the 21st.
21 I didn't see him that night.
22 "On the morning of 22 July I left home about 7 am,
23 travelled as usual to Surbiton to do my job as
24 a cleaner. At 12 or 12.30 that day, I remember somebody
25 told me that they had shot one of the terrorists at
91
1 Stockwell tube. It made me feel scared again because
2 there had been another incident on the tube. I was
3 planning to call Jean to check if he was all right but
4 didn't get round to it.
5 "On the afternoon of the 22nd, as I saw Patricia, we
6 arrived home together, I asked if she had heard from
7 Jean. She explained that he had swapped his day off and
8 he was starting a new job so we weren't that bothered
9 that he wasn't home.
10 "The following day, Patricia was out in the morning,
11 I got up at 9 am and noticed there was no sound coming
12 from Jean's bedroom. I went into his room, and noticed
13 that his bed was made up and it didn't look as though he
14 had come home the night before. Then at about 12 midday
15 Gesio and a friend of his turned up at the flat and
16 asked if Jean was at home or if I knew where he was.
17 I said I was a bit worried as he hadn't been home. He
18 asked if I was his cousin, and when I said yes, he said
19 could he come in. He told me that some police officers
20 had come round to his house in the early hours."
21 She then explains that Gesio told them all what the
22 police had said at that meeting and I don't think we
23 need to go into all of that.
24 Finally she says this:
25 "Jean never had any problems with the police or
92
1 authorities. He wasn't scared of anything. He had been
2 stopped by the police on a few occasions. I remember
3 there was one occasion he talked about which was about
4 a month before his death. He said he had been stopped
5 by the police at Brixton tube. He had a rucksack with
6 tools in it. He had been licked by a sniffer dog and
7 the police then asked him some questions. He actually
8 praised the way the police had dealt with him.
9 I remember him saying you should always tell the truth.
10 I am sure if the police had stopped Jean on the morning
11 of the 22nd he would have fully co-operated with them.
12 I am certain that I would not have behaved in any way
13 that would have caused serious concern. He was a calm
14 individual and always behaved reasonably and was polite
15 to the police."
16 She too says that she believes the facts stated in
17 that statement are true and that statement is dated
18 21 February of this year.
19 So we are now turning please to the next witness,
20 John McDowall.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you, Mr Hilliard. First of all,
22 is Mr McDowall in communication at the moment? Yes, he
23 is, I can see that he is there. Before we embark on
24 this evidence, because we are now coming to evidence
25 given by senior police officers, I want to say a few
93
1 words about questioning witnesses on sensitive matters.
2 Everyone will appreciate, I am sure, that the
3 training and tactical documents used by the police in
4 dealing with suicide terrorists are kept confidential to
5 prevent terrorists knowing how to counter police
6 tactics.
7 Nevertheless, all the interested persons in this
8 inquest have received disclosure of sensitive material
9 on terms of confidence and it's inevitable that, as this
10 inquest develops, questions will be asked about police
11 strategy and tactics as they relate and related to the
12 operation on 22 July.
13 I wish to adopt a procedure that ensures that all
14 relevant evidence is given, but also ensures that the
15 operational effectiveness of the police is not
16 compromised.
17 If at all possible, I wish to avoid hearing sections
18 of evidence in private for reasons that everyone will
19 understand. It may be that a question will be asked of
20 a police witness, and that that witness will feel that
21 he cannot answer the question without revealing
22 sensitive information in public.
23 If that happens, and I wish this direction please to
24 be passed on, the witness should not hesitate to
25 indicate his concern to me. I may ask him to write the
94
1 answer or information on a note, and pass it to me and
2 I can then decide whether or not the information should
3 be revealed.
4 Coming now to Deputy Assistant Commissioner
5 McDowell, I can't ask him to write me a note as he is
6 not here and is giving evidence via videolink. As far
7 as Mr McDowell is concerned, if you, sir, have any
8 concerns of this kind you should say so and we will ask
9 for the information that is troubling you to be
10 communicated to my staff during a break in the
11 proceedings.
12 A. Thank you, sir.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Ladies and gentlemen, I think you ought
14 to know why it is that Mr McDowall is giving evidence
15 through --
16 MR HILLIARD: Sir, perhaps we might just deal with that,
17 only because he and I have discussed it and I know
18 exactly what the position is.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: By all means.
20 MR HILLIARD: We will get you sworn or affirmed first of
21 all, Mr McDowall, and then we will embark.
22 DEPUTY ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER JOHN MCDOWALL (sworn)
23 Questions from MR HILLIARD
24 MR HILLIARD: Is your name John McDowall?
25 A. It is, yes.
95
1 MR HILLIARD: My name is Nicholas Hilliard and I will ask
2 you some questions first of all on behalf of the
3 Coroner, and then you will be asked questions by others
4 in due course.
5 A. Yes.
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Could I just say, please, Mr Hilliard,
7 sorry to interrupt, Mr McDowall, it's quite likely that
8 you are going to be -- I think it's very likely -- in
9 the witness box for more than the rest of today. I know
10 what Mr Hilliard is about to tell the jury and what I do
11 want to say to you is that if at any point you require
12 a break, you are not to hesitate to say so and you will
13 get one.
14 A. Thank you very much, sir.
15 MR HILLIARD: Mr McDowall, you are now, is this right,
16 a Deputy Assistant Commissioner in the
17 Metropolitan Police?
18 A. That's correct, sir.
19 Q. So there is no mystery, I think you are content for me
20 to indicate that you have a serious illness which means
21 that you are confined to a wheelchair, and so you are
22 giving evidence remotely, as it were, and in addition
23 I think you may need some help having documents passed
24 and so if we see a hand coming into picture, that's
25 what's going on.
96
1 A. That's correct, sir, and if I may just very briefly
2 thank everyone concerned for allowing me to give my
3 evidence in this way due to my somewhat altered
4 circumstances.
5 Q. Yes. Before you became a Deputy Assistant Commissioner,
6 and at the time that we are principally concerned with,
7 July of 2005, were you a commander in the
8 Metropolitan Police?
9 A. Yes, I was, sir, I was a commander in the then
10 Anti-Terrorist Branch and prior to that in the Covert
11 Policing Branch.
12 Q. I think you have a copy of our jury bundle there; is
13 that right? If you have, I would be grateful if it
14 could just be opened for you and passed to you at our
15 divider 2.
16 A. Yes, sir.
17 Q. Will you forgive me, Mr McDowall, for asking you about
18 what will seem to you, I am sure, very basic matters,
19 but you are the first Metropolitan Police officer
20 witness we have had and you know the inquest is at
21 a very early stage, so it's obviously a good time to get
22 our heads around some of the terms?
23 A. Absolutely, sir, yes.
24 Q. Can you see that at the beginning of our divider 2 we
25 have a document that says: "Guide to Metropolitan Police
97
1 Structure and Officers"?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Then various of SO or Specialist Operation branches are
4 dealt with there; do you see, SO followed by a number?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. In the course of your evidence, you will undoubtedly be
7 referring to some of those. If you can remember to give
8 us the letters and the number, and then the translation
9 afterwards, as it is early days for us, it would be very
10 helpful.
11 A. Yes, sir.
12 Q. Then Mr McDowall, over the page, which is really why
13 I have come to this document with you, so we can get
14 an idea of the structure, your page I hope is headed
15 "Metropolitan Police Service Ranks"?
16 A. Yes, sir.
17 Q. Then the very first subheading is "ACPO Ranks"?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. We will come to what follows in a minute. Can you tell
20 us what that means?
21 A. It means Association of Chief Police Officers.
22 Q. Is that a grouping that officers of a certain seniority
23 automatically belong to, to that association?
24 A. Yes, it is. Above the rank of commander in London or
25 Assistant Chief Constable outside of London.
98
1 Q. So if you are an Assistant Chief Constable or above
2 outside of London, or a commander or above in London,
3 you will have -- is this right -- what's called ACPO
4 rank?
5 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
6 Q. Right.
7 A. Could I also, if it may be helpful, just point out that
8 on the previous page it is stated there under "notes, B"
9 just to avoid confusion, I hope, SO19, the firearms
10 branch, was designated thus in 2005. It has since
11 become CO19, but they are one and the same branch, sir.
12 Q. Right. So CO19 and SO19 for all practical purposes,
13 interchangeable, different ways of referring to the same
14 thing?
15 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
16 Q. All right.
17 Then just looking at the Metropolitan Police,
18 Commissioner at the top, Deputy Commissioner, one of
19 those?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Assistant Commissioner, how many of those?
22 A. Four of those.
23 Q. And then Deputy Assistant Commissioner, of which you are
24 now one?
25 A. Correct.
99
1 Q. And can you just give us an idea how many of those are
2 there?
3 A. I am ashamed to say I think it is around ten.
4 Q. Right. Then the rank below that, the rank that you held
5 in July of 2005, commander?
6 A. That's correct.
7 Q. Can you give us any idea then, and if you can't, it
8 really doesn't matter, in July of 2005, how many
9 commanders there would have been?
10 A. It would have been in the order of 25 or so, but the
11 number does fluctuate.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Simply to get it into context,
13 Mr Hilliard, what's the overall strength of the
14 Metropolitan Police force?
15 MR HILLIARD: Can you help us with that?
16 A. Yes, it's currently around 31,000 police officers and
17 something like 15,000 police staff, civilians.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
19 MR HILLIARD: Then, Mr McDowall, just because this might be
20 a useful document for you, if you turn on in this
21 divider to, numbers in the bottom right-hand, page 6.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Can you see Metropolitan Police officers, and then there
24 are names and descriptions of roles?
25 A. Yes.
100
1 Q. As you turn on, page 8 is a good example. 8, 9, 10, 11
2 and 12, indeed.
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. You will see that on a number of occasions, witnesses
5 are referred to either simply by a first name or by
6 a letter and a number?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. Those are witnesses, I am sure you appreciate, in
9 respect of whom anonymity has been granted and you might
10 find it useful to have this by your side, if you are in
11 any doubt, this will indicate to you whether somebody is
12 to be referred to by their full identity or by the
13 pseudonym.
14 A. Yes, sir. Thank you.
15 Q. Finally, just before coming a little bit down to the
16 detail of the facts, Mr McDowall, so there is no mystery
17 and again no difficulty about this, do you have access
18 to the two witness statements that you have made?
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 Q. And I'm going to ask so far as those are concerned that
21 you have those not just access but right in front of you
22 now.
23 A. Yes, sir.
24 Q. Do you have a book that contains notes that you made in
25 July of 2005, handwritten notes?
101
1 A. Yes, sir.
2 Q. Do you have a transcript of evidence that you gave at
3 the criminal trial, the one we have heard about,
4 a Health and Safety at Work Act prosecution against the
5 Office of the Commissioner for Metropolitan Police? Do
6 you have that?
7 A. Yes, I have, sir.
8 Q. Then in addition, I think you heard the Coroner make
9 reference to documents that deal with
10 Metropolitan Police tactics so far as suicide bombers
11 are concerned, and do you have a copy of material that
12 relates to that?
13 A. I have, sir, yes.
14 Q. All right. Just by way of background so far as you are
15 concerned, did you join the Metropolitan Police Service
16 in 1980?
17 A. Yes, I did.
18 Q. Thereafter, did you work in a variety of locations, both
19 as a uniformed officer and a plainclothes one?
20 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
21 Q. And plainclothes, does that mean, I don't know if it's
22 still called it, the CID, the Criminal Investigation
23 Department?
24 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
25 Q. Then in 1998, did you receive a promotion in the
102
1 Criminal Intelligence Branch?
2 A. Yes, sir.
3 Q. What job did you take on then?
4 A. I became Detective Chief Superintendent in charge of the
5 then SO11, as it was known, which is the Criminal
6 Intelligence Branch.
7 Q. Right. Were you appointed a commander in the
8 Metropolitan Police Service in November of 2002?
9 A. Yes, that's correct.
10 Q. When you got that appointment, did you have any
11 particular area of responsibility?
12 A. Yes, structures had changed once again slightly as they
13 are wont to do in this organisation, and I became
14 commander with responsibility for covert policing.
15 Q. Does that mean undercover policing?
16 A. It includes undercover policing, it includes
17 intelligence at a service level, that is a pan-London
18 level and a variety of other functions that belong to
19 the world of covert policing such as prison intelligence
20 and so on.
21 Q. I will come to 2005 in a minute, but just to move ahead,
22 were you made a Member of the Order of the British
23 Empire in 2007 for services to the police?
24 A. Yes, sir, I was.
25 Q. When were you promoted to Deputy Assistant Commissioner?
103
1 A. I was promoted to my current rank in December of last
2 year, 19 December.
3 Q. All right. Can you just give us a little bit of detail
4 about the job that in July of 2005 you held, please?
5 A. Yes, the job that I held in July 2005 was commander of
6 the then anti-terrorist branch or SO13 as I think it has
7 been referred to in some documents. As well as that
8 I had a dual responsibility which was to be the deputy
9 national co-ordinator for terrorist investigations.
10 I was working to my boss, Deputy Assistant Commissioner
11 Peter Clarke, and that role entailed the management and
12 co-ordination of terrorist investigations in England and
13 Wales.
14 Q. Given that job description, after the events on
15 7 July 2005, I will ask you a little bit about that in
16 a minute, but after those events, given what your job
17 was, did you become involved in that operation?
18 A. Yes, I immediately became involved in the operation to
19 establish who was responsible for those attacks, and
20 whether there were other perpetrators at large.
21 Q. Just so we have some evidence about it, we have heard
22 about it, but on 7 July of 2005, is this right, three
23 bombs were exploded on the tube network, and one on
24 a bus?
25 A. Yes, that's correct, between the hours of roughly
104
1 8.50 am and 9.50 am in the morning, and those explosions
2 very unfortunately caused the four terrorists concerned
3 to lose their lives and 52 other innocent people, and in
4 addition to that more than 900 people were injured in
5 those attacks, many extremely seriously.
6 Q. Was that the first experience in this country of suicide
7 bombing?
8 A. Yes, yes, it was, sir. There had been an instance of
9 two UK nationals travelling to Israel prior to that to
10 conduct a suicide attack but nothing at all by way of
11 suicide attack in this country.
12 Q. Did your investigation into those events take you to
13 West Yorkshire?
14 A. Yes, they did, on 10 July 2005, I went to West Yorkshire
15 to lead the Yorkshire end of the investigation, since
16 that's where the investigation we had acquired to that
17 point had taken us.
18 Q. Can you just, again no-one is asking for anything more
19 than is in the public domain, spell that out for us to
20 a bit?
21 A. Yes. As a result of documentation found at the scenes
22 of the attacks, particularly at the tube sites, we were
23 led to a number of addresses in West Yorkshire, and
24 these were searched over the course of the days
25 following the 10th. And ultimately this led us to the
105
1 discovery of a, what we colloquially describe as a bomb
2 factory, simply because its purpose was to construct
3 explosive devices, bombs, and at those premises, we
4 discovered a very, very substantial amount of explosive
5 that had been left behind by those attackers.
6 Q. Can you give us some idea, both in terms of the
7 investigation into those events, and in terms of steps
8 that were being taken with a view to a possible
9 recurrence of something of that kind happening again;
10 what was the commitment in terms of police officers,
11 police officer time, effort and so on? Can you just try
12 and sketch that in for us a bit, please?
13 A. Yes, I'll certainly try. I think it's very difficult to
14 recapture the circumstances of the time, but certainly
15 this was the largest investigation that I think any
16 police service in the UK had conducted. It consumed
17 massive resources because of the scale of the atrocity
18 that had been perpetrated. There were extremely long
19 working days, I recall at one point working a stretch of
20 44 hours, and I don't believe I was in any way alone in
21 that. We were extremely anxious to try to discover
22 whether there were other perpetrators that we had no
23 knowledge of. We were surprised, I have to say, by the
24 attack in the sense that there was no intelligence to
25 pre-warn us of the existence of the plot. And we were
106
1 extraordinarily anxious about the prospect of any kind
2 of recurrence or any further attack upon us, although
3 again we had no intelligence to suggest that that was
4 going to be the case.
5 But, for example, I recall a statistic, we have the
6 national -- sorry, we have the hotline, the
7 anti-terrorist hotline which receives calls from the
8 public, and ordinarily its workload is some region of
9 tens a week, tens of calls. I recall that at that
10 period certainly between the 7 July and the 21 July, we
11 had had something in the order of 3,900 calls to the
12 hotline. Each of those calls ordinarily we feel it is
13 our duty to chase down to ascertain exactly whether
14 there is any veracity in what is being passed to us by
15 way of intelligence or information.
16 Perhaps that might serve to illustrate the enormous
17 strain that we were under.
18 Q. Right. If I can move on, then, to 21 July of 2005?
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 Q. When did you become aware of the attempts that had been
21 made to detonate further devices on that day?
22 A. I became aware during the course of the morning, or late
23 morning I suppose, lunchtime-ish, I was actually on my
24 way back from West Yorkshire where I had still been
25 conducting the investigation into 7 July, when
107
1 I received a phone call to that effect.
2 Q. What was your understanding of what had happened on this
3 occasion?
4 A. My understanding was that we had suffered an attempt,
5 another attack that bore worrying similarities to the
6 attack on 7 July. In other words, the intended targets
7 had been three tube trains and a bus, and as I later
8 discovered, it appeared that the explosive devices that
9 were used appeared to be very similar, if not the same,
10 to those used on 7 July. And again at that time we had
11 never seen explosive devices of that type.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Forgive me for interrupting,
13 Mr Hilliard.
14 I told the jury in opening, Mr McDowall, that there
15 was in fact a fifth device which was not either on
16 a tube or a bus. Could you just tell us very briefly
17 about that?
18 A. Yes, sir, that's quite correct. It was found some days
19 after the 21st, abandoned in an area of parkland in,
20 I think it was Shepherd's Bush, where it had been left
21 by an individual who has since been I believe convicted
22 for his role. But he was, we believe, a co-conspirator
23 who had second thoughts at the last moment.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Was that a device of similar design and
25 construction to the ones found on the trains and the
108
1 bus?
2 A. Yes, sir, but we were not aware of it on the 21st, we
3 only found it a day or so later, I believe.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you, I understand.
5 MR HILLIARD: You spoke of worrying similarities between the
6 two events. Just so we can follow that through a bit.
7 Obviously the events of 21 July are way beyond worrying
8 in themselves. Can you just help us, the fact that
9 there might be a connection between the two of them,
10 what was the specific worry there, if it's not obvious?
11 A. We were obviously extremely concerned after the
12 attempted attack on the 21st that this may not be the
13 only other cell that was intending to attack us in this
14 form and frankly at that point we had no knowledge at
15 all of how many terrorists were intending to use this
16 method of attack or over what time period. That was the
17 specific further anxiety, if I can put it that way, that
18 came to us on the 21st.
19 Q. Right. I don't know whether you can remember
20 approximately or whether if you look at any of your
21 documents it will help, but do you know what time you
22 got to New Scotland Yard on 21st?
23 A. May I just refer to my statement, please?
24 Q. Of course. Paragraph 5 may help you.
25 A. Yes. I arrived -- it doesn't actually state the time,
109
1 I don't recollect, but I immediately set about drawing
2 together those that had the facts as we knew them to
3 hand, in order to try to make some sense and give some
4 direction to this new further investigation. To that
5 end, I was joined by a number of fellow senior officers
6 from the anti-terrorist branch, SO13, in the conference
7 room here, and at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon,
8 I went to brief on, to give a briefing of what I was
9 then aware of, to my boss, the Assistant Commissioner of
10 Specialist Operations.
11 At 3.35 in the afternoon, I then joined a video
12 conference between senior officers from SO13 or the
13 anti-terrorist branch, and the senior investigating
14 officer, Detective Superintendent Richard Gething, who
15 is a Metropolitan Police officer who I had left in
16 Leeds, together with other officers from the West
17 Yorkshire Police, and we then, during the course of the
18 conference, discussed the events of the day and reviewed
19 whether we thought there were any linkages to the
20 earlier attacks and whether we may have missed some,
21 whether we needed to re-examine things we had already
22 discovered as a result of the 14 days of investigation,
23 and whether there were any additional lines of inquiry
24 that we should be pursuing.
25 Q. So that's an example of how, amongst other things, one
110
1 of the things you are considering is the topic you have
2 told us about, is this question of was there a linkage
3 between the two events, is the same team or members of
4 the same team around what was going on, involved in the
5 second incident?
6 A. That is correct. That's quite so. And in addition, we
7 had become concerned that one of the sites of one of the
8 attacks on the 21st at the Oval may have had an aspect
9 to it of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear
10 threat, what's known as CBRN threat, and that arose
11 because of an early report that there was some
12 suspicious readings being emitted or being received at
13 that scene. And there was also -- there were a number
14 of other things going on, but I have recorded one in
15 particular about possible suspect being sighted at
16 University College Hospital, and that in itself then led
17 to a fairly large scale police deployment to surround
18 and search the hospital.
19 Q. We heard a little bit from the Coroner in his opening
20 and we will hear in due course from witnesses about
21 Gold, Silver, and Bronze levels of authority or
22 leadership, however one wants to put it. Are you
23 familiar with the topic?
24 A. Yes, sir.
25 Q. In respect of these events, did you have any
111
1 responsibility on a Gold, Silver or Bronze level?
2 A. Yes. I became Gold for the investigation into the
3 attacks on the 21st. I was already Gold for the attacks
4 on the 7 July because Deputy Assistant Commissioner
5 Clarke had left for his annual leave. I think it was on
6 the 21st. So I had that role. Would it help if I tried
7 to describe the roles more fully?
8 Q. Yes. Could you do this for us, just first of all, and
9 if you want to go into detail so far as the
10 investigation into events on the 21st is concerned, then
11 by all means do so.
12 But could you just start, Mr McDowall, with Gold,
13 Silver, Bronze, just in principle how you would describe
14 those levels?
15 A. Yes. The Gold role is really setting a direction,
16 a strategy, it's the responsibility of that individual
17 to establish what in broad terms we are seeking to
18 achieve, and that can take the form -- well, according
19 to who the Gold is, that can be an extremely detailed or
20 it can be an extremely brief strategy. I have known it,
21 in a former incarnation for a football Gold, for
22 example, there is a Gold whenever there is a large
23 football match, for example, to simply set a strategy
24 that two sets of fans be kept apart before, during and
25 after the match.
112
1 The role of Silver is more concerned with the
2 tactics, the implementation of the Gold strategy.
3 The role of Bronze is generally to be in charge of
4 an aspect of an operation, so it may be that there is --
5 again just using the football analogy, there may be
6 a Bronze for the away supporters, and another one for
7 the home support, another one for outside the ground and
8 so on.
9 In the circumstances pertaining to the 21 and
10 22 July, there were a number of Silvers concerned, and
11 there may also -- I hope this clarifies rather than
12 confuses -- there is a requirement when there is
13 a firearms operation for a Silver firearms to be
14 deployed with the firearms teams.
15 But effectively that might be construed as a Bronze
16 role. So there is a degree of flexibility and
17 interchangeability between the appellations, if that
18 assists rather than confuses.
19 Q. So if we have it clear, Gold will be setting what the
20 direction is or the aim or strategy it might be called;
21 Silver you have explained how to implement that?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Or tactics, as that's sometimes called; and then Bronze,
24 as it were, at ground floor level, could be in charge of
25 one particular aspect of the tactics?
113
1 A. Yes, that's correct.
2 Q. Is that roughly it?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. Thank you.
5 So you were Gold for the investigation into the 21/7
6 bombings?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. Right, or attempted bombings, I should say. Thank you.
9 We looked this morning in a different context at
10 some CCTV film, but it was principally to do with
11 Mr de Menezes's journey from Scotia Road to Stockwell
12 tube, and then what we could see of events there on such
13 CCTV film as there was; all right?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. On the 21st, were you, as Gold, concerned at all with
16 the question of retrieval of CCTV film insofar as it
17 might help identify those who had been responsible?
18 A. Yes. That was one of the priority lines for us, lines
19 of enquiries, to seize and capture whatever
20 closed-circuit television there was available to us,
21 primarily and obviously for purposes of trying to
22 identify who was responsible.
23 Q. Can you just give us an idea: how does the process go
24 for getting hold of it? Do you as Gold say: I think
25 this is a good idea, we must get hold of it, and pass it
114
1 down the chain; how does it work?
2 A. We -- as I have said, I think, we convened a conference
3 as soon as I got back to London, with all of the senior
4 managers from the anti-terrorist branch present, and
5 an SIO, a Senior Investigating Officer, was appointed
6 for the attack, the events of the 21st, and we discussed
7 what our priorities would be.
8 We had found unusually that on 7 July, in the
9 aftermath of 7 July, that we convened a management
10 structure that allowed all of the senior managers, that
11 is Detective Superintendents, and Detective Chief
12 Inspectors, primarily, to have a role, a part to play,
13 supporting a lead Senior Investigating Officer, almost
14 a first among equals.
15 We adopted a very similar approach on 21st and 22nd,
16 and the Senior Investigating Officer, the initial Senior
17 Investigating Officer I believe was an individual by the
18 name of John Prunty for the events of the 21st, and
19 among the priorities raised at that meeting was the
20 seizure of CCTV footage, and he then took that forward.
21 So he would have deputed a Detective Inspector to go and
22 arrange for that.
23 In fact, I think we had formed a team specifically
24 and solely after 7 July to deal with CCTV issues, and
25 from recollection, I believe that they were tasked with
115
1 that.
2 We also called upon support from detectives
3 elsewhere in the Metropolitan Police, something like 100
4 I believe that I briefed on the evening of the 21st, and
5 many of those were deputed to -- we obviously organised
6 them into teams to go and collect or seize whatever CCTV
7 footage we could.
8 Q. I am sure it's obvious, but one of the priority tasks
9 then is to try to get the best pictures you can, if
10 possible, of those who were responsible for trying to
11 set these bombs off, for obvious reasons so far as
12 catching them is concerned?
13 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
14 MR HILLIARD: Sir, I am mindful of the time, I don't know
15 whether we will have a break or whether the LiveNote
16 recording or you would like a break?
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: How are you getting on, Mr McDowall?
18 A. Sir, I am fine, I don't know what time you will sit to,
19 but I am happy to -- without knowing that, I am
20 committing myself to saying I'm happy for the moment,
21 sir.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's all right. There are two people
23 I have to worry about, you are one and the LiveNote lady
24 is the other.
25 Go on for another half hour, Mr Hilliard.
116
1 MR HILLIARD: All right.
2 So far as the bombs themselves were concerned on
3 21st, had you or did you receive information about
4 whether or not those devices were viable by which I mean
5 did they actually have the potential ever to go off? Do
6 you follow what I am asking?
7 A. Yes. We did discuss this. This I think came up in
8 a meeting at 5.15 that afternoon, again in the
9 conference room at the anti-terrorist branch, where
10 explosives officers, and these are individuals employed
11 by the Metropolitan Police Service, specifically for
12 their skills in dealing with explosive devices, suspect
13 packages and so on, all of whom have currently at least
14 significant experience of theatres of military activity.
15 They were briefing the command in detail following their
16 arrival back from the scenes that they had been deployed
17 to.
18 The messages and the opinion provided was that the
19 attacks had involved viable explosive devices, but they
20 were not at that point able to say with certainty why
21 they had not detonated. A 90 per cent assessment was
22 given that they were peroxide-based explosives on the
23 basis of burns tests that were carried out, and
24 obviously this further raised fears of a link to the
25 7 July.
117
1 Q. Just explain why, because?
2 A. Sorry, because the 7 July had involved peroxide-based
3 explosive.
4 Q. Right.
5 A. As we know, on that occasion, an extreme viability.
6 The booster charge also contained peroxide-based
7 explosives and the booster had, on these occasions, on
8 the 21st, detonated very effectively. This was felt to
9 be clearly either a home produced triacetone triperoxide
10 known as TATP, or a hexamethylene triperoxide, HMTD,
11 both extremely, extremely dangerous and volatile
12 explosives. In the bomb factory in Leeds that was
13 discovered, we found TATP literally sprayed around the
14 premises and on the floor. If I can say that that
15 explosive will detonate if trodden on, for example, so
16 again the use of a peroxide-based, it's a reduction of
17 peroxides to produce these two explosives, that again
18 seems to link possibly anyway the two attacks.
19 Linkage was also discussed with devices that had
20 been discovered in the boot of a car left at Luton
21 station by one of the 7/7 bombers. In that, objects
22 that I can best describe possibly as being almost like
23 hand grenades, almost capable of instant detonation once
24 lit had been left in the vehicle, aside from the loaded
25 firearm. And shrapnel has also been found in the
118
1 vehicle.
2 So it was felt that the devices that had been
3 recovered on the 21st would probably have been viable
4 with a larger boosting element.
5 Q. Right. Then I want to go on, please, to a meeting that
6 I think you chaired that took place at 6.15, and if it
7 helps it's paragraph 16 in your statement, if you have
8 that all right.
9 A. Yes, thank you, sir.
10 Q. Briefly, who was at that meeting?
11 A. It was a full meeting with the SO13 command team and
12 it's also --
13 Q. So that's the anti-terrorist command team?
14 A. Yes, sir, I apologise.
15 Q. No, no.
16 A. And also SO12, Special Branch officers, together with
17 again West Yorkshire officers via a videolink, and
18 I believe at that time -- no, that's a later meeting.
19 I was going to say I believe there were representatives
20 from other agencies present but they came later that
21 evening.
22 Q. All right. With those who were there at the 6.15
23 meeting, did you discuss what your priority tasks were?
24 A. Yes, we did. We discussed those, which included
25 obviously ensuring that the scenes were being exploited
119
1 as fully as possible and perhaps I should explain what
2 I mean by that. As a result of the highly methodical
3 and quite unusual method of examining scenes that has
4 been used by this branch or this command for many years,
5 it is a sort of fingertip approach to gathering minute
6 quantities of trace evidence. We wanted to ensure that
7 that process was being adopted and that process was the
8 process that had led us to the first clues after the
9 attacks on the 7th.
10 We also wanted to make sure that we were seeking
11 witnesses as quickly as we could, and as widely as we
12 could, and that the operations room had been set up to
13 co-ordinate what, by virtue of the fact that this was
14 a failed attack, we now regarded as a manhunt.
15 Q. Can I get you to pause there. I am going to look at
16 other priorities in a moment, but you say that one of
17 them was to make sure that the operations room had been
18 set up to co-ordinate a manhunt. Was that an operations
19 room that was going to be set up at New Scotland Yard?
20 A. Yes, it was, sir, yes.
21 Q. And was an appropriate, in your view, operations room
22 selected?
23 A. Yes. I decided that we would use the operations room
24 housed within Special Branch as it then was on the 16th
25 floor of New Scotland Yard. There were some alternative
120
1 venues that could have been used, but I weighed the
2 potential benefit of using those other locations. There
3 are two locations that are within the public order
4 world, and both of those for a variety of reasons, size,
5 interoperability and linkage to other agencies, and the
6 communications facilities they have, were not felt,
7 I didn't feel, to be at all suitable.
8 Q. Pause a minute. When you say in the public order world,
9 do you mean, suppose for example there was a large
10 demonstration or something of that sort in London, is
11 this the kind of room that might be used to deal with
12 an incident like that?
13 A. Yes, that's correct, I believe it's known as GT, and for
14 once, the acronym defeats me, I am afraid.
15 Q. You rejected that, because you thought the
16 communications from that room to other agencies weren't
17 really what you wanted, weren't good enough?
18 A. That's correct, and the physical layout as well, and the
19 location would not have been ideal.
20 Q. All right. So that's one that you rejected. We don't
21 need a lot of detail, but did you say there was another
22 that you rejected as well?
23 A. Yes, there was -- there is a control room known as
24 Central 3000, C3000, which is a room that is used by
25 Specialist Operations as then was, it's now used by the
121
1 specialist crime directorate and that is primarily used
2 to co-ordinate kidnap investigations, crimes in action.
3 I was minded to consider that alternative location,
4 but as a result of our attempt at using it for
5 an unrelated but a terrorist issue, after the 7 July,
6 where we were looking for another individual, that also
7 proved to be unsuitable.
8 I have to say that I had some considerable
9 familiarity with that room because of my previous work,
10 so on the face of it I would have been quite keen to use
11 it. When I discovered that it wasn't ideal for our use,
12 I went downstairs, it's located on the 4th floor, just
13 to satisfy myself that the reasons for its non-use were
14 valid. I was told then that again it was a problem with
15 connecting the Cougar, that is the covert radio channels
16 in sufficient quantity to it, and also that there was no
17 facility there for what is known as a forward
18 intelligence cell, which is a secure area used by the
19 security service when they are working in a partnership
20 with us.
21 So again the physical and the technological
22 difficulties had been outlined to me, so that's why
23 I decided on the 16th floor.
24 Q. Having enough facilities to be able to receive
25 communications from the Cougar covert radios, that was
122
1 important, is this right, because that's the system that
2 the surveillance officers use?
3 A. Yes, that's correct, sir.
4 Q. Right. Then the room that you did settle upon, if you
5 have the jury bundle there, and you turn first of all,
6 please, to behind divider 20?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. It's not the best plan in the world but do you recognise
9 the room?
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 Q. What's that room?
12 A. That is the 16th floor operations room.
13 Q. Right. Is that the room you selected?
14 A. Yes, it is. Commonly the room which is towards the
15 right which is noted as intelligence cell --
16 Q. Yes?
17 A. -- is the forward intelligence cell or FIC as it's
18 known, which would be used by colleagues from the
19 security service.
20 Q. So that if they are involved in an operation, as you
21 have indicated, they will have an area of their own that
22 they can go to if they want to?
23 A. Yes, it's a secure area but as you will see it has swipe
24 card access so it is connectable to the control room and
25 that clearly that is felt to be advantageous.
123
1 Q. Left-hand edge of the plan is one end of the room;
2 correct?
3 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
4 Q. And then if we come up, as you say, it's got number 12
5 at the top, if we come down that line, that's a solid
6 wall or partition, is this right, with a swipe card door
7 that you can go through in the middle of it?
8 A. Yes, sir.
9 Q. Then, as you say, into the forward intelligence cell
10 room and beyond that there is another room simply called
11 a briefing room?
12 A. That's correct, and if you look in the operations room
13 itself, the front row of desks there, you will see are
14 marked as being equipped for Cougar radio. It has
15 "Cougar desktop".
16 Q. Absolutely, so that's what that refers to?
17 A. Yes, and also just to the left there is another one.
18 Q. Yes, yes, I am sure we all have those along the top,
19 thank you.
20 Then, Mr McDowall, if you would be kind enough just,
21 if we look, if you go behind divider 21 --
22 A. Yes, sir.
23 Q. -- we have some photographs here, and if we just look
24 at the first one, if you have it on its side, you will
25 be able to make out 33A bottom left?
124
1 A. Yes, yes, I have it.
2 Q. Just so we understand, that brown door we can see at the
3 back of the room as we look, is that the door into the
4 forward intelligence cell?
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 Q. The desks, as it were, to the front left as we look,
7 those are the ones that had the reference, is this
8 right, to the Cougar positions?
9 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
10 Q. Then if you turn over, please, to 33B --
11 A. Sorry, and also the desk immediately in front of you.
12 Q. Absolutely right, that's the other one.
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Then if you turn over the picture, that's just showing
15 rather more of the back of the room, isn't it?
16 A. Yes, sir.
17 Q. If you turn over to 33C, that's taken, is this right,
18 from the other end of the room, so the brown door is now
19 behind the photographer?
20 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
21 Q. On the walls, I don't know if I am looking at it right,
22 but are those, as it were, boards that you can mark
23 things on? I am looking at the back left corner, back
24 right corner, as we look at these pictures. Can you
25 see?
125
1 A. Yes, that's correct, they are white boards for marker
2 pens and there are screens. If you can just see them,
3 a bit more to the right at the top, there are a number
4 of flat panel screens as well which also display
5 a variety of things according to what the person in
6 charge of the control room wants to display there. Some
7 of those are CCTV feeds and so on.
8 Q. What are we looking at if we go over to 33D, on the wall
9 there?
10 A. I think that's -- not actually clear, but I think it is
11 a close-up of those marker boards.
12 Q. It is, but those are marker boards, are they, rather
13 than anything else?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. All right. So far as that room was concerned, did you
16 have any anxieties or doubts about its suitability as
17 the room from which you were going to be co-ordinating
18 a manhunt of this scale?
19 A. I felt that it was the best option that we had available
20 to us, so I suppose I would say that one always has some
21 concerns about what you are going to be confronted by
22 and the scale that it will achieve and whether the room
23 will be large enough, but for the reasons I think I have
24 outlined, I felt this was our best option.
25 Q. Right. Then I am just going back to your statement.
126
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Forgive me for interrupting again. If
2 the room on the 4th floor was not suitable for the
3 reasons that you have told us about, was this
4 effectively the next largest room?
5 A. Yes, sir, I believe it is, with the exception of the
6 public order room GT, but it's not configured for people
7 to be familiar with and to easily go into. There is of
8 course another reason why the other room, Central 3000,
9 would have been a concern to me to use and that's simply
10 that, despite what had befallen us, policing in London
11 was continuing or trying to continue, and Central 3000
12 is dedicated to kidnap investigations, in other words
13 life at risk. And given the number of kidnaps that we
14 now and even in 2005 experience on a yearly basis, if we
15 had taken that room, it would have meant that we would
16 have been extremely -- well, it would have been
17 extremely difficult for us to run a live kidnap
18 operation.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I understand.
20 MR HILLIARD: I am going back, Mr McDowall, to paragraph 16
21 of your witness statement. Do you remember we were
22 looking at priorities in the 6.15 meeting on the 21st?
23 Do you remember you told us you about making sure that
24 everybody was finding all the clues they could at the
25 scenes, that witnesses were being sought, we spoke about
127
1 CCTV film, and you have just dealt with the question of
2 a control room.
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. And just other priorities, please?
5 A. Yes, the other priorities were to make sure that other
6 branches that we may need to support us were fully aware
7 of what was going on and what had happened that day,
8 specifically obviously firearms officers and technical
9 and surveillance specialists who, in the general run of
10 things in connection with a manhunt, would most likely
11 be required. We also needed to ensure that --
12 Q. Can we just pause with those for the moment? Does the
13 concern, then, with firearms and technical and
14 surveillance specialists, does the concern with them
15 include the concern that, as it were, they are on
16 standby and are as available as they can be?
17 A. At this time, it would be to make them aware, if they
18 were not already aware, of everything that we knew and
19 just to say to them that, although we had nothing at
20 that time specifically to ask them to deploy against or
21 to ask them to do for us, that it was likely that at
22 some point we might be calling on their services, and
23 obviously these are specialist officers of whom there
24 are a finite number, so the purpose of that being placed
25 on standby, as it were, is to say, "Look, make sure you
128
1 are available if you can be, look at who's around, look
2 at what officers are on leave, look at what your
3 resilience is and so on, just in case we need you".
4 Q. You will understand, I am sure, that one of the issues
5 that we will be attempting to grapple with in the course
6 of this inquest is, as it were, the time it took for
7 SO19 officers, for these purposes, I will say, to arrive
8 at Stockwell underground station. All right?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. That's putting it very shortly. So I just want to
11 explore this with you a bit, please, if I can.
12 You have decided, as Gold, that that is a priority
13 task; yes?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Can you help us: what will happen after that to ensure
16 that somebody is finding out who, of surveillance
17 officers, technical officers and firearms officers are
18 around, who's on leave? What's available? What's the
19 mechanism? After you have said at the meeting "this is
20 a priority task", whose job is it to take this on and do
21 something about it?
22 A. It could be one of a variety of individuals, it could be
23 the Senior Investigating Officer, who is present at that
24 conference or meeting, it could be that he or she
25 delegates that task to a Detective Inspector or
129
1 a Detective Chief Inspector. It may have been decided
2 that the operations room co-ordinator would attend to
3 that task. There is no hard and fast rule, as it were,
4 as to who will take that task on, but generally what
5 happens is after a meeting of that ilk, those present
6 will stay and just work out between themselves who is
7 going to do what, who's going to ensure that a task is
8 actually fulfilled.
9 Q. Does anybody tell you who it is who has decided they are
10 going to take on a particular job?
11 A. No, that wouldn't be usual.
12 Q. Right. Does anybody report back to you, you having set
13 a priority, in due course what has happened about the
14 particular priorities that you have set? Just so we
15 understand how it worked.
16 A. Yes, there will be a point usually at the discretion of
17 the Silver, as to when to give Gold an update as to
18 what's happening. That depends upon all sorts of
19 things, for example how busy they are, what's happening,
20 whether the circumstances are busy or quiet and so on.
21 The reverting back to Gold, as it were, would tend to be
22 done more in the case that we had come up against
23 an obstacle, so, for example, we had agreed that we were
24 going to warn surveillance teams and no-one could get
25 hold of them on the phone or they were all committed or
130
1 they were all wherever. That would then obviously
2 require further decision-making as to how we were going
3 to overcome that particular difficulty.
4 Q. Does it really work like this: you spell out the
5 priorities and you really work on the basis, given where
6 you are in the chain, that --
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. -- somebody doesn't understand them they will ask you,
9 but assuming you have set them out and nobody has said
10 they don't understand, that it will only come back to
11 you if there is some difficulty or obstacle in carrying
12 out really the order you have given, if I can put it
13 that way?
14 A. Absolutely, and of course a further reason why it
15 happens that way is also because, in the role that I had
16 of being Gold for this attack and also for that of the
17 7 July, there was so much else also occurring at the
18 time, that sort of constantly reverting to me for minor
19 adjustments or alterations probably wouldn't have been
20 feasible physically anyway.
21 Q. Did you, at any time, get a report back about the
22 availability of firearms or surveillance or technical
23 resources, either perhaps unusually for somebody just to
24 happen to tell you what was going on or for anybody to
25 come and say that there was a problem?
131
1 A. Not that I recall, no. Certainly as the investigation
2 continued through I think it was the next seven or eight
3 days, there were occasions when people reverted to me
4 for precisely that reason but at this point, no.
5 Q. Presumably, I don't know, is this right, that if
6 somebody comes back to you with a problem, is part of it
7 that you may be able to use your seniority, your
8 authority, to unblock the problem?
9 A. That's correct, or alternatively suggest an alternative.
10 Q. Then, Mr McDowall, I think I interrupted you, just
11 because I wanted to dwell on that one for a moment, you
12 were just going on to help us with other priorities in
13 the 6.15 meeting that you set?
14 A. Yes, one of the other priorities was to ensure that our
15 intelligence unit was reinforced. I don't think it's
16 an exaggeration to say that we were swamped at that time
17 with assistance being offered, information coming in,
18 and also different lines or theories being developed by
19 our partner agencies as to what may have befallen us.
20 We had to reinvigorate the anti-terrorist branch, as it
21 was then, hotline, which is the public phone number
22 I referred to earlier, simply because of also those
23 massive numbers of calls that were coming in that
24 I referred to.
25 We also needed to set ourselves fair in the event
132
1 that we arrested the suspects, and that for terrorism
2 prisoners is quite a task in its own right, with sterile
3 facilities for prison reception. So we have to make
4 sure that we have sufficient vehicles and cells set up
5 in a sterile way to receive prisoners.
6 We also wanted to ensure that as many people as
7 could be briefed who needed to be briefed were briefed
8 and among those were ports officers who work for the
9 police service, are generally attached to Special
10 Branches up and down the country, and who work in
11 various numbers at the large and indeed the smaller
12 ports because we were concerned that one possibility was
13 that those responsible might try to flee the
14 jurisdiction.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: If I may interrupt, Mr Hilliard, there
16 is a question I have been asked to put to you,
17 Mr McDowall, but I also suspect you may answer it
18 a little later on, but I'll give you the question.
19 Did you at any point get a feedback either from your
20 Silver, the next man down, or anybody of the ranks you
21 have been talking about, Chief Inspectors or DIs, on the
22 general progress of the priorities that you had been
23 setting at this meeting?
24 A. I think during the evening, and there were other
25 meetings as we went on into the early hours of the
133
1 morning, those tasks would have been updated to me
2 because we -- I would have been asking, others would
3 have been asking: where are we with this or that. So
4 yes, there would have been some feedback coming in as we
5 went along.
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: How would it get to you?
7 A. It would get to me personally round a conference table
8 as we worked our way through whatever problems we were
9 discussing or the issues or the priorities and how far
10 they were progressing, sir.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
12 MR HILLIARD: But just so I am clear, because I think you
13 were dealing with this earlier, do I have it right, that
14 certainly so far as firearms or technical or
15 surveillance matters are concerned, any update that you
16 are getting is not indicating that there is
17 a difficulty?
18 A. That's correct.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It's a progress report?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
22 MR HILLIARD: All right.
23 Now, I don't think we need to go into this in great
24 detail, but one issue was whether or not you were going
25 to go public with an appeal to the public through the
134
1 media; is that right?
2 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
3 Q. Was that exercising a fair amount of thought? Was that
4 a difficult judgment to make at the time?
5 A. It was an extremely difficult judgment to make. Clearly
6 both courses of action had advantages and disadvantages.
7 And as the hours progressed, this was a matter that
8 I was constantly thinking about. When I left New
9 Scotland Yard in the early hours of the 22nd, we had --
10 I had made a decision that we would be conducting
11 an overt investigation, in other words using the images
12 or the CCTV footage that we had by way of public appeal.
13 Q. Can I just pause to interrupt. I should have made it
14 clear. Was that at the heart of this decision you had
15 to make, that if you had images of those responsible,
16 whether you broadcast those and sought help from the
17 public, anybody who knew them, or could say where they
18 were, or whether you kept those to yourself, as it were,
19 and sought to try to find the people by your own
20 methods, for fear of scaring them off if there was
21 a picture in the newspaper, something of that sort?
22 A. That's correct, and I recall noting the sort of pluses
23 and minuses to the options in my red book, my log book,
24 on the evening of the 21st, and noting down those
25 advantages and disadvantages. I don't know whether you
135
1 want me to go into detail, if you don't, then --
2 Q. I don't particularly at the moment, others might do, we
3 are going to look at particular aspect of your red book,
4 but that's the book you are actually making your notes
5 in as you go along?
6 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
7 Q. I am going on to your paragraph 20, please, and I just
8 want you to help us with this topic. At about 8.15 in
9 the meeting, did you have a meeting with somebody called
10 Superintendent Swain?
11 A. Yes. Yes, sir, I did.
12 Q. I just want you to help us, please, with the first topic
13 that you have indicated in your witness statement that
14 I have, the first topic that you met to discuss with
15 him?
16 A. Yes, the first topic we discussed was the
17 Operation Kratos, as I think it was then known, that
18 scenario which effectively is the scenario where the
19 public or police are confronted by suicide operatives.
20 It was at that time in 2005 a very much less well
21 developed and less well considered topic than it is now.
22 Superintendent Swain was one of the very few people that
23 had some particular knowledge, I think having been asked
24 to research this subject by another senior officer in
25 the Met. So he seemed to be a good source of potential
136
1 knowledge and advice.
2 Q. So this was reference to strategies that the
3 Metropolitan Police had devised, as you say, to deal
4 with suicide bombers; is that right?
5 A. That's correct.
6 Q. You will appreciate it's a topic I'm just going to ask
7 you a little bit about, but we obviously have to be
8 careful, I am sure you understand that?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. But it's a topic, you remember the Coroner mentioned
11 earlier, that information has been provided about it to
12 all interested persons?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. In addition to Operation Kratos, was there also
15 something called Clydesdale?
16 A. Yes, there was. There were two scenarios, I suppose,
17 for want of a better expression, that had been catered
18 for. One was I think known as, it's full name was
19 Operation Kratos People at the time, which was
20 a scenario where there was a spontaneous threat, in
21 other words, for example, someone rang up and said
22 I think there is a suicide bomber at Euston station or
23 something, and how police would respond to that.
24 Operation Clydesdale was a -- some guidance around
25 a scenario where intelligence, either intelligence had
137
1 been received or it was felt that there may have been
2 the likelihood that some pre-planned event might attract
3 a suicide bomber. So I don't know whether some State
4 occasion or something like that.
5 But there was no other -- there was no eventuality
6 or no contingency, no scenario that had been developed
7 to fit the circumstances that were confronting us on the
8 21st. In other words, the failed attack, not knowing
9 what the intentions of the would-be attackers were.
10 Q. So the one you say Operation Kratos People, somebody
11 rings in and says: I think there is a suicide bomber
12 about to do this, that or the other, Clydesdale, where
13 there is a pre-planned event going to happen, as you say
14 some State occasion of some kind and you have
15 intelligence that that maybe be the subject of an attack
16 by a suicide bomber or bombers; yes?
17 A. That's correct, yes.
18 Q. So Superintendent Swain, as you understood it, was
19 familiar with the theory and the learning behind that;
20 is that right?
21 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
22 Q. So that's one of the reasons, is this right, why you
23 wanted a meeting with him?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. Did you have that meeting with him?
138
1 A. I did, sir, yes.
2 Q. And amongst other things -- we are going to come back to
3 one aspect later -- did you discuss this question of
4 Operation Kratos People with him?
5 A. Yes, I did.
6 Q. Then in the course of the rest of the evening, did you
7 have -- I am not going to go through all of them --
8 inevitably a number of other meetings involving these
9 events that were going on?
10 A. Yes, that's correct. I think virtually back-to-back
11 until I left.
12 Q. Yes. Did you consider the question of something called
13 a Designated Senior Officer or a DSO?
14 A. Yes, yes, we did.
15 Q. Was that at a meeting that took place at 10.10 in the
16 evening?
17 A. That's correct, yes.
18 Q. Deputy Assistant Commissioner McDowall, I am just going
19 to carry on. If you tell me that you are tired and you
20 need a break, you will just say, won't you?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. We will probably go on for another half hour, and if you
23 did want a break, I am told you would not be alone in
24 it.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That sounds like a reproof to me,
139
1 Mr McDowall.
2 A. I think it's what we call a clue, sir.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: In that case, 20 minutes.
4 A. Thank you, sir.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well. I have 20 to; 4 o'clock,
6 please, ladies and gentlemen.
7 (3.40 pm)
8 (A short break)
9 (4.00 pm)
10 (In the presence of the jury)
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Mr Hilliard, another 30, 40 minutes?
12 MR HILLIARD: Certainly, yes.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Pick your own time as a convenient
14 moment.
15 MR HILLIARD: Thank you very much.
16 Mr McDowall, we were just at a ten past 10 pm
17 meeting on 21 July of 2005, and you said that there was
18 discussion at that meeting of something called
19 a Designated Senior Officer, or a DSO?
20 A. Yes, that's correct.
21 Q. First of all, can you just tell us, who was at the 10.10
22 in the evening meeting? I don't need necessarily
23 particular names but what sort of a meeting was it?
24 A. Again it was a meeting of senior management from the
25 anti-terrorist branch, and Special Branch, and I believe
140
1 from one or two other parts of the Metropolitan Police
2 Service. I don't recall now whether there were
3 representatives from other agencies there or not, but
4 I don't believe so. But it was one of those meetings
5 where we were reviewing where we had got to, and it was
6 at that meeting, as you quite rightly point out, that
7 the discussion around the Designated Senior Officer was
8 raised.
9 A Designated Senior Officer was something that was
10 envisaged for the Operation Clydesdale scenario. It
11 wasn't envisaged in the event of a spontaneous suicide
12 bombing threat --
13 Q. So the spontaneous one, that's Kratos People, if we get
14 the terminology right. Clydesdale is for a pre-planned
15 event and you get some intelligence that someone might
16 be going to suicide bomb it. That's Clydesdale.
17 For Clydesdale, you say something called
18 a Designated Senior Officer was envisaged but not for
19 Kratos People, not for a Kratos incident?
20 A. That's correct, and primarily I believe because in the
21 event of a Kratos People incident, it's virtually
22 impossible to get that person holding that role to the
23 command suite anyway in time, or that's the theory
24 behind that response to that scenario, whereas clearly
25 obviously in a pre-planned operation you have the time
141
1 to appoint and find a Designated Senior Officer.
2 Q. So what you mean is, to give the example you gave, if
3 somebody rings in and says: I think there is a suicide
4 bomber at a station, you are saying in that event, we
5 will come on to it in a minute, but selecting the
6 Designated Senior Officer may be very difficult in the
7 time available. If, on the other hand, somebody says in
8 two weeks' time at this or that event --
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. -- it's going to be the subject of an attack by
11 a suicide bomber, then you proceed a bit differently?
12 A. Yes, correct.
13 Q. All right. Can you help us: what is a Designated Senior
14 Officer?
15 A. A Designated Senior Officer in the context of Clydesdale
16 is the senior officer and at that time it was
17 a requirement that it should be a trained officer of
18 ACPO rank -- again that acronym, Association of Chief
19 Police Officer rank --
20 Q. You were telling us about at the start.
21 A. Yes. So therefore it would be a commander in London, or
22 above, to perform the role of that Designated Senior
23 Officer, and the role of that person is to take charge
24 of the critical decisions of how to deal with a suicide
25 bomber threat when that has become apparent.
142
1 Q. Does that include, as it were, what one might describe
2 as the most critical decision of all, for example about
3 opening fire, does that include that in an operation
4 Clydesdale situation with a Designated Senior Officer?
5 A. Yes, sir. Yes.
6 Q. Now, can you just help, in what context did then the
7 Designated Senior Officer arise at this meeting and with
8 the events that you were facing as you understood them
9 at 10.10 in the evening?
10 A. As I recall, a decision had been made or was being made
11 at that time by those in other parts of the Metropolitan
12 Police Service, I think more likely the public order
13 side of things, that it would be sensible to have
14 a Designated Senior Officer on continual standby for any
15 type of event or threat that came in by way of emergency
16 call. So in other words, I guess they were altering the
17 Kratos People document on the basis that we had now had
18 our second suicide attack, as we believed at the time,
19 and in the context of appointing that person,
20 a discussion took place about having a dedicated
21 Designated Senior Officer for this investigation because
22 of the potential threat from suicide bombers contained
23 within that specific investigation as well.
24 Q. Just to spell it out, because you had four people who,
25 on the face of it, had tried to set off what you thought
143
1 were viable devices and to kill themselves in the
2 process, but they had escaped?
3 A. That's correct, yes.
4 Q. At that meeting, the 10.10 meeting, you had discussed
5 you told us the question of appointing a Designated
6 Senior Officer for these purposes. Did you get so far
7 as identifying an individual or not at that stage?
8 A. I don't believe that, at that meeting, an individual was
9 identified, but I do believe that some point shortly
10 thereafterwards, if not at that meeting, then
11 an individual was identified.
12 Q. Right. Was that in both contexts, so, as it were,
13 a Designated Senior Officer generally for the
14 Metropolitan Police and then one specifically for this
15 investigation?
16 A. Yes. Yes.
17 Q. Whenever they were identified, can you help us, please,
18 in each instance with who they were?
19 A. Yes. I believe -- in fact, I am not now certain who was
20 identified for what was, what I described as the generic
21 Designated Senior Officer role for London, but Commander
22 Cressida Dick was identified as the DSO or Designated
23 Senior Officer for our investigation. In fact, those
24 decisions were made by those who held a list of fully
25 qualified individuals and who would have known their
144
1 availability and so on.
2 Q. Does either Commander Carter or Allison, I think the
3 other name, do those ring a bell?
4 A. Yes, they do. I know that at that time both of them
5 were dealing with this issue, and I believe on the
6 morning of the 22nd, one of those individuals --
7 I believe it may have been Commander Carter -- was
8 fulfilling the role of Designated Senior Officer for
9 London, as it were.
10 Q. All right. Also at this meeting, and if it helps I am
11 looking at paragraph 26 of your statement, did you
12 consider who you would begin to show CCTV images of the
13 suspects to, so people who might be able to help
14 identify them?
15 A. Yes, that's correct.
16 Q. I asked you whether the firearms question came back to
17 you at any stage, or certainly the topic. If you look
18 at your paragraph 27, does that help?
19 A. Yes. We agreed that there was a need for a firearms
20 authorisation because, if we were successful in our
21 objective of discovering those that had tried to attack
22 us on the 21st, then clearly it was highly likely that
23 there may have been some form of confrontation between
24 ourselves and them, at which point clearly we would have
25 required to have been armed to ensure public safety and
145
1 our own safety, our own officers' safety.
2 Q. What happened about getting an authority so far as
3 firearms were concerned?
4 A. At 10 to midnight, Detective Chief Superintendent White
5 from the anti-terrorist branch gave authorisation for
6 firearms to be deployed, after we had had a discussion
7 over the need for them or likely requirement for them.
8 Q. Is the position this, we don't need to go into the
9 detail, I think, that an officer of a certain rank or
10 above needs to give permission for firearms to be
11 deployed or used in a particular operation; it's not
12 down to --
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. In a planned operation, not down simply to the officer
15 who has the gun simply to decide whether or not he goes
16 out with it?
17 A. That's absolutely correct.
18 Q. Again I am not going through, you understand,
19 Mr McDowall, everything that you dealt with, but at
20 2 o'clock in the morning or so, did you go, did you
21 leave New Scotland Yard and go to a hotel to get some
22 rest?
23 A. Yes, I did.
24 Q. Did you indicate that you would be back at about
25 4 o'clock in the morning?
146
1 A. I did, yes, because I needed to review the decision that
2 we had taken or I had taken before leaving, that this
3 was going to be an overt appeal for public assistance,
4 specifically because I was informed that the newspaper
5 print run was around 4.30 in the morning, so if we
6 wanted to get it out through that medium, then clearly
7 a decision needed to be taken.
8 Q. Right. Did you come back on or come back to New
9 Scotland Yard at about 4 o'clock in the morning as you
10 had indicated?
11 A. Yes, I came back at 4 am.
12 Q. At about 20 past 4 in the morning, were you provided
13 with some particular information?
14 A. Yes, I was. I should say that at 4 am I gave my staff
15 officer, a Detective Inspector Michael Forteath, I gave
16 him permission to leave and get some sleep. He had been
17 performing the role of a dedicated loggist for me since
18 events of the 7th, and that period in time is probably
19 the only time in this period that we were separated, but
20 he had had no sleep since goodness knows when, so he
21 then left, which meant that I then reverted to trying
22 and making my own notes, which is why I have some in my
23 red book. So just to explain that.
24 At 4.20 --
25 Q. Just pausing, so we have a dedicated loggist, someone
147
1 who has the specific task of making notes of key
2 decisions that are made and the reasons for them, that
3 kind of thing.
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Make a log of those?
6 A. Events that take place, meetings that are held, who
7 tends to be present, decisions made, it's that sort of
8 thing, sort of capture the progress of events.
9 Q. All right. You were just going on to 4.20 and some
10 particular information?
11 A. Yes, at 4.20 I was approached in my office by Detective
12 Chief Inspector Pat Mellody, and other officers from
13 Special Branch who told me about the discovery of
14 a South Bank club gym card in the name of
15 Mr Hussain Osman in a rucksack containing the bomb at
16 the Shepherd's Bush scene, and membership of gyms,
17 again, appeared at that time to be a potential common
18 factor between these individuals and the cell involved
19 in the bombings of 7 July. It was something that
20 clearly they were keen on.
21 This club or gym had been visited in the intervening
22 hours, the early hours of the morning, and an address
23 had been acquired for Hussain Osman at 21 Scotia Road,
24 SW2. According to records, this was an address shared
25 with an individual by the name of Abdi Samad Omar, and
148
1 this name was of significant interest because it linked
2 to another confidential counter-terrorist inquiry that
3 had been ongoing prior to this time.
4 Q. So in a rucksack that the Shepherd's Bush bomb had been
5 in, there is a gym card in the name of Hussain Osman?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. Enquiries are made at the gym, and there an address for
8 Hussain Osman appears as 21 Scotia Road. Also, as you
9 have said, the link to somebody called Abdi Omar?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Did the gym card have a picture that, certainly if the
12 card was accurate, was a picture of Mr Hussain Osman on
13 it?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. It was a gym card with a picture?
16 A. It was. But we had gym records as well, so by that
17 time, just after 4, I suppose, in the morning, we had
18 analysed closed-circuit television images of the
19 suspected bombers from the scenes and identified four
20 suspects. When we examined the gym records, we had
21 photographs for Osman and Omar which were felt to be
22 good likenesses, good comparisons to the CCTV images
23 that we had. And I examined those likenesses personally
24 because I was obviously thinking about making a major
25 change to the strategy at this point. So I wanted to be
149
1 as clear as I could be that we had something to work
2 with.
3 Q. Just so we followed, so what you were thinking was: if
4 you had identified this person, and you were on their
5 trail, that rather than what you called the overt
6 approach, so giving the press the pictures from the CCTV
7 and seeking the public's help in finding these people,
8 that you might in fact be able, as it were, to make your
9 own enquiries without alerting anybody rather than going
10 through the media? Is that the change you were thinking
11 of?
12 A. That's correct. It was a hugely significant decision to
13 have to make, and as I think I pointed out earlier,
14 there were a number of advantages or disadvantages to
15 taking a particular course of action, either keeping it
16 as an overt issue or trying to now mount a covert
17 investigation, and having weighed up those
18 considerations, I decided that we had a very good
19 prospect of mounting a covert investigation with the
20 identification of this address; not just this address
21 but also some of the other information that was
22 available to us around Omar, that, as is very often the
23 case with these investigations, as soon as you have
24 a certain amount of information, other information
25 starts falling in as well, and before you know it, it
150
1 becomes a quite broad amount of intelligence that you
2 can put together.
3 Crucially for me, we had potentially the opportunity
4 to identify an address where potentially two of these
5 suspects may be located, but also by virtue of
6 conducting surveillance on those premises, we had again
7 the possibility of linking them to their fellow
8 suspects. But certainly perhaps mounting an arrest in
9 due course in which we had some control, and the chief
10 disbenefit of going overt in the media was that I was
11 fearful that if we did that, we might provoke these
12 individuals to go out and try and bomb London again.
13 Or, if it was felt that they were about to be
14 discovered, they may become desperate and we had example
15 of Madrid to follow. There aren't, or there weren't
16 certainly at that time, too many learning experiences
17 but that was clearly one of them.
18 Q. You say you have the example of Madrid, to everybody
19 that may not be, as it were, easy to recall. Just in
20 a sentence or two, what had happened there?
21 A. After the attacks on the trains in Madrid, which were
22 detonated remotely by telephones and explosive devices,
23 the bombers were tracked to an address in a suburb of
24 Madrid called Legan, and to cut a long story short, they
25 were alerted to police presence, police attempted to
151
1 stop an individual outside those premises, who managed
2 to escape, and as a result of that obviously
3 communication was relayed back into the premises and
4 an individual lent out of the window and started firing
5 a submachine gun at police.
6 Police then decided to mount what is known
7 technically as a dynamic entry; in other words very
8 rapid entry, probably with a small charge on the door,
9 maybe not, but in any event a raid conducted on the flat
10 to try to get the element of surprise, and they had
11 constructed other explosive devices which they then
12 detonated, killing themselves and the lead police
13 officer going through that particular door.
14 That in a nutshell is what happened in Madrid.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: And that, as I understand it, was made
16 possible from the point of view of those particular
17 people because the information had gone public as to
18 what the police were doing?
19 A. I believe, sir, that possibly the suspect that made good
20 his escape alerted them, or police activity around and
21 outside the premises, they may have seen it themselves
22 and obviously divined what was happening.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I follow, and hence the need for
24 undercover operation as far as you were concerned.
25 A. It was certainly a major consideration, yes.
152
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
2 A. I mean, crucially, I should say in Madrid, they had
3 a substantial amount of explosives left in the flat,
4 which was also our experience in Leeds after the 7 July,
5 as I said earlier.
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
7 MR HILLIARD: All right.
8 Can you help us with this: had you yourself had the
9 opportunity to compare the photograph on the gym card in
10 the name of Hussain Osman and the CCTV film taken from
11 the tube?
12 A. Yes, as I say, I looked at those images personally
13 because I wanted to be reassured before I made a major
14 change of decision.
15 Q. Right. Did they appear to you to be one and the same
16 person?
17 A. They did.
18 Q. And if the gym card was accurate, he was called
19 Hussain Osman?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. As you understood it, in the rucksack, apart from the
22 picture on the gym card, had there been any other
23 photographs, did you understand, of Hussain Osman in the
24 rucksack?
25 A. In that rucksack I don't recall.
153
1 Q. I have no idea how it worked, but was the rucksack and
2 it's contents brought to you at New Scotland Yard or was
3 that not how it happened at all?
4 A. No, I had -- the closed-circuit television images
5 obviously had been downloaded and printed.
6 Q. Yes?
7 A. And also I had the gym records which I believe showed
8 photographs for both Osman and Omar.
9 Q. Again, I do not want to necessarily go into the
10 specifics, but can you help us: did you have available
11 to you, or did the Metropolitan Police have available to
12 them, any images of their own of Hussain Osman? Do you
13 see? So aside from the question of anything in the
14 rucksack, aside from the question of anything in the
15 CCTV film, once you had a name Hussain Osman. Do you
16 follow the question?
17 A. I do. At that time, I was not aware of any other
18 photographs in our possession, I have subsequently
19 learnt that we did have images available which had not
20 been, I think, identified as those individuals.
21 Q. So you mean later you discovered you did not have
22 pictures of him, but at that time no-one had put a name
23 to them; is that it?
24 A. Yes, there was, as I briefly alluded to, another
25 counter-terrorist inquiry that had been ongoing, and
154
1 a number of photographs had been taken during the course
2 of that surveillance. Those photographs certainly
3 included Omar as far as I am aware now, but at the time
4 he had obviously not been assigned an identity as far as
5 I am aware.
6 Q. But did they also include Hussain Osman?
7 A. I believe so.
8 Q. Do you think in his instance too, not a name attached to
9 him?
10 A. No, absolutely not. I may say in the course of that
11 inquiry, a very substantial number of photographs were
12 taken.
13 Q. So we are not talking about five or six or seven, you
14 mean an enormous number?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Hundreds?
17 A. Not hundreds, but pushing up to tens and tens and tens
18 of people, many of whom we had not been able to
19 identify.
20 Q. Just two other pieces of information I want to ask you
21 about. First of all, a Nissan Primera motor car. Can
22 you say anything about that, please, a black one?
23 A. Yes. This vehicle was discovered in the vicinity, the
24 near vicinity of Scotia Road. This was a vehicle, along
25 with a number of other vehicles, that had also emerged
155
1 as a result of the inquiry I have just referred to. And
2 it was linked -- I believe it was linked at that time to
3 Abdi Omar.
4 Q. Had you given any instructions or did you give any
5 instructions about a search for relevant vehicles that
6 might be in the area of Scotia Road?
7 A. Yes, having I think been made aware of the intelligence
8 that we had about this other inquiry, I asked for
9 a search, a quick search, a sweep of the vicinity of the
10 location, just to see whether we could firm up what we
11 already had, with sightings of any of the vehicles that
12 were concerned. And that was what, I think, turned up
13 the vehicle you have just alluded to.
14 Q. Do you know when that was done?
15 A. I am not sure of the precise time, but I think it was
16 pretty soon after that, after obviously sort of, I guess
17 it would be between 4.15, 4.30 -- no, it would have been
18 later than that, probably after 5 am, I guess.
19 Q. So a car I wanted to ask you about; another piece of
20 information, an address, 61 Portnall Road?
21 A. Yes, I was told also of a possible further address for
22 Abdi Omar at 61A Portnall Road, which had been uncovered
23 from the Department for Work and Pensions records.
24 I think this was Jobseeker Allowance correspondence that
25 was recovered.
156
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's in a different part of London,
2 isn't it?
3 A. Yes, sir, sorry, that's in West 9.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
5 MR HILLIARD: And --
6 A. Sorry, I should also say that the Nissan Primera vehicle
7 I believe we had intelligence at the time that it was
8 registered to that address in West 9.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, and to Omar?
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 MR HILLIARD: Now, at 4.55 in the morning, did you make
12 a particular decision and record it?
13 A. Yes, I did. I made a decision and recorded it at the
14 same time that an operation should be mounted around the
15 address that we discovered in Scotia Road, and it was
16 that, at that time, that I set a Gold firearms strategy,
17 and I made that decision after discussing it with others
18 who were present at the time, and the tactical options
19 that were open to us. These included Detective Chief
20 Inspector Pat Mellody, who I have mentioned previously,
21 and I also recall Detective Superintendent
22 John Macbrayne from the Anti-Terrorist Branch and the
23 essence of that strategy was to try to control the
24 premises at Scotia Road through covert surveillance,
25 follow any persons leaving them until it was felt safe
157
1 to challenge them, and then stop them. I should clarify
2 that when I say --
3 Q. I am going to stop you there. So to control the
4 premises through covert surveillance, follow any person
5 leaving the premises until it was felt safe to challenge
6 them, and then to stop them. That's the Gold strategy,
7 firearms strategy that you set; is that right?
8 A. That's correct.
9 Q. At 5 to 5 in the morning?
10 A. That's correct.
11 Q. I am only stopping you, Mr McDowall, because tomorrow
12 you will be able to find I'm sure the passage in your
13 red book, we will hand out copies of the note and it
14 will be much easier if we examine that strategy when we
15 all have the document in front of us, if that's all
16 right?
17 A. Yes, sir.
18 MR HILLIARD: Would that be a convenient moment, sir?
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Certainly. Just one question,
20 Mr McDowall, if I may, if only to satisfy both mine and
21 the jury's curiosity, although it doesn't actually
22 advance the investigation that much further.
23 A. Yes.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Was Osman in fact in 21 Scotia Road
25 that night?
158
1 A. From recollection, I don't believe so, but I would have
2 to check that for you, sir.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's all right, I think the answer
4 may well be that he was not. But he was subsequently
5 tracked down, was he not?
6 A. He was sir, he was tracked down and eventually arrested
7 in Rome on 29 July having been assisted and facilitated
8 out of the country by a variety of individuals. As you
9 know, there were eventually 16 people convicted for
10 a variety of offences. I think now you prompt my
11 memory, sir, that he had gone elsewhere to one of those
12 other addresses where someone assisted him.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Just to cut a long story short, because
14 he fled abroad, he was eventually brought back and put
15 on trial for, presumably, conspiracy to cause
16 explosions?
17 A. Yes, sir.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: And convicted?
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: And sentenced?
21 A. Yes, indeed, to a minimum 40 years, I believe.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That at least completes the other half
23 of the story, as it were. Thank you very much,
24 Mr McDowall.
25 10 o'clock tomorrow, please.
