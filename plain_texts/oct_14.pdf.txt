2 (10.00 am)
3 (In the presence of the jury)
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I haven't forgotten that one of your
5 number has a medical appointment tomorrow, and I am very
6 grateful to hear that the lady has said that 4.30 would
7 do, but I do not want to push it too hard, and I will
8 bear it in mind.
9 What I am going to ask you is this: even half
10 an hour makes a difference to the progress of the
11 inquest. Would it cause any of you serious trouble if
12 I decide that we are getting into difficulties if I said
13 9.30? All right.
14 I don't propose to do it unless I have to. I might
15 want to do it tomorrow because of the short day. I know
16 full well that to ask a jury to sit for six hours is
17 a very considerable strain and it's not a good idea, but
18 if we need to catch up a bit, I may on occasion ask you
19 to come in at 9.30 just to claw back an extra half hour.
20 You can then look very hard at any counsel who you think
21 is taking his time.
22 MR HOUGH: Mr Esposito, please.
23 CHIEF INSPECTOR VINCENT ESPOSITO (sworn)
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you, Mr Esposito. Please sit
25 down.
2
1 A. Thank you, sir.
2 Questions from MR HOUGH
3 MR HOUGH: Is your name Vincent Esposito?
4 A. Yes, sir.
5 Q. Could you give your rank to the court?
6 A. Chief Inspector, sir.
7 Q. My name is Jonathan Hough and I will ask you questions
8 first on behalf of the Coroner, then you will be asked
9 questions by each of the interested persons.
10 You, I think, have been known in quite a lot of the
11 documents and in the past as Trojan 80 but you are not
12 obviously seeking anonymity here?
13 A. No, sir.
14 Q. You were Commander Dick's tactical adviser on
15 22 July 2005?
16 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
17 Q. You made two main witness statements, one very shortly
18 after events on 25 July 2005?
19 A. That's correct, yes.
20 Q. And another one very recently dated, I think,
21 23 September 2008, where you have dealt with a couple of
22 particular things which have cropped up in recent times?
23 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
24 Q. You were also, I think, interviewed by the IPCC in 2005?
25 A. Yes, I was, sir.
3
1 Q. But you did not, I think, give evidence at the Health
2 and Safety trial?
3 A. No.
4 Q. If you have the statements that you made to hand, please
5 have them out. It will speed things up and there is no
6 difficulty with you looking at them.
7 A. Thank you, sir.
8 Q. Going through your career background, I think you joined
9 the Metropolitan Police in 1980?
10 A. That's correct, yes.
11 Q. You have been an authorised firearms officer since 1983?
12 A. Around 1983, yes.
13 Q. Did you join CO19, the firearms branch, the specialist
14 firearms branch, in 1995?
15 A. Yes, I did, sir.
16 Q. Did you become a senior tactical adviser in 2002?
17 A. Yes, I did, yes.
18 Q. So having joined initially as a tactical adviser, you
19 were then promoted to a senior tactical adviser?
20 A. It's a natural progression as a result of the work that
21 you do, sir.
22 Q. While in CO19, have you been an armed response vehicle
23 officer?
24 A. I was an inspector in charge of the armed response
25 vehicle reliefs.
4
1 Q. Have you also been a tactical adviser in operations
2 involving armed response vehicles?
3 A. Yes, I have, sir.
4 Q. Have you been a specialist firearms officer on the
5 ground yourself?
6 A. Yes, I have been trained as a -- I did the specialist
7 firearms officers' course.
8 Q. Have you been a tactical adviser in many specialist
9 firearms officer operations?
10 A. In a great number of operations, sir.
11 Q. We have heard about, by evidence, the level of training
12 and marksmanship you have to achieve to pass those
13 courses, and you have achieved those and passed those
14 courses, I think?
15 A. Yes, sir.
16 Q. I think you have also been a firearms instructor for
17 training other specialist firearms officers?
18 A. Yes, I was in charge of specialist firearms training for
19 some time. The officers are actually on the ground now.
20 Q. Are you currently in charge of training senior officers
21 to play the role of Silver and Gold Commanders in
22 firearms operations?
23 A. At the beginning of this year, I was selected to
24 undertake the Gold firearms and the Silver firearms
25 training on behalf of the Met.
5
1 Q. Have you also been involved in developing the
2 Metropolitan Police's tactics and training for dealing
3 with suicide terrorists?
4 A. Yes, yes, I have.
5 Q. We have heard of those referred to as Kratos and
6 Clydesdale and I'll touch on those in a few moments.
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 Q. In the course of that, I think you have written quite
9 a number of the presentation documents used for training
10 other officers?
11 A. Yes, I have, sir.
12 Q. Can I then turn to that topic by way of background,
13 Kratos and Clydesdale, and it's really dealt with in
14 your witness statement of last month.
15 A. Yes, sir.
16 Q. Is this right: after September 11th 2001 the
17 Metropolitan Police began working on responses for
18 dealing with suicide terrorism in this country?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. I think a working group was set up under then
21 DAC Barbara Wilding?
22 A. Yes, it was DAC Barbara Wilding. There are a number of
23 other officers and I was chosen and selected to
24 represent 19 and to develop the tactics.
25 Q. I think over time three policies were developed;
6
1 Kratos Person or Kratos People was one of them?
2 A. Yes, sir.
3 Q. Was that for dealing with spontaneous calls from members
4 of the public about suspicions?
5 A. Yes, it was purely for spontaneous pieces of
6 intelligence emerging so that there was a filtering
7 system at that time and a response.
8 Q. Filtering in terms of?
9 A. A command, a command filtering system and a tactical
10 response.
11 Q. So if you get a lot of calls, deciding which ones merit
12 a particular response?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Second policy, Kratos Vehicle?
15 A. Yes, that was specific tactics in relation to vehicle
16 borne improvised explosive devices.
17 Q. You needed something separate for that because vehicles
18 require special methods of interception and so on?
19 A. Yes, that's correct.
20 Q. Thirdly, Clydesdale?
21 A. Operation Clydesdale was developed so that in the events
22 of a threat emerging, where there already existed
23 an operation, this operation could be overlaid to deal
24 with that.
25 Q. You said if there was already an operation, this
7
1 operation could be overlaid; what kind of operations are
2 you talking about already existing?
3 A. A major event, really, something like
4 Trooping the Colour, something like that sort of event.
5 Q. So you have got a major event which you might be dealing
6 with in public order terms, and you then receive
7 information --
8 A. And then specific intelligence around suicide terrorism,
9 that this operation could be implemented.
10 Q. You get from intelligence, from any number of sources,
11 that somebody might be planning a suicide attack on
12 an event that you know about?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Those were the three policies, and obviously as we have
15 heard, nothing like dealing with failed suicide bombers
16 and the manhunt for them?
17 A. No, sir, that would have been just a normal policing
18 firearms response operation counter-terrorist
19 operation --
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Mr Esposito, I am not sure how easily
21 the jury are hearing you. You tend to talk towards
22 Mr Hough.
23 A. I am sorry, sir.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Not at all. Just bear in mind that
25 your voice has to go across the room.
8
1 MR HOUGH: Now, I think you yourself developed and started
2 delivering presentations to teams of specialist firearms
3 officers in early 2002?
4 A. That's correct, yes.
5 Q. So in the early stages of the development of these
6 policies?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. You participated, I think, in a training day for ACPO
9 rank officers, including Commander Dick, in late 2002?
10 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
11 Q. We have heard from her about an early group of officers
12 being trained up to play the DSO role?
13 A. Yes, there were a small group of ACPO officers selected
14 at that time to perform that role, sir.
15 Q. We will turn to that role in a second. I think later in
16 October 2002, you acted as the tactical adviser to a DSO
17 in an exercise designed to try out Operation Clydesdale
18 tactics?
19 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
20 Q. Was that a tabletop or live time exercise?
21 A. It was a live time exercise involving CO19 firearms,
22 involving surveillance, involving command, that was run
23 from a command centre at Scotland Yard.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: A live time exercise means you actually
25 did it on the ground.
9
1 A. Yes, sir.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: In the actual place, as to where
3 an event might have taken --
4 A. Yes, sir.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: As a matter of interest, where was it?
6 MR HOUGH: You don't need to answer questions like that.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: All right, don't worry.
8 A. Thank you, sir.
9 MR HOUGH: In 2003, did you organise a series of further
10 exercises?
11 A. Yes, I did, sir.
12 Q. Then in July 2003, did you prepare and deliver a series
13 of presentations to officers of the ACPO ranks and to
14 chief firearms officers, instructors, rather, from
15 forces across the country?
16 A. Yes. As a result of what we had developed within the
17 Metropolitan Police, we wanted to share that knowledge
18 with the rest of the firearms community and the command
19 community across the country.
20 Q. I think that the MPS's training documents were in fact
21 used across the country?
22 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
23 Q. I think you finally gave further tactical presentations
24 in around June 2005; is that right?
25 A. It was a continuous rolling programme, especially to the
10
1 specialist firearms officers, to the ARV officers, that
2 as things developed, the presentations changed over the
3 time and those changed presentations were then delivered
4 to all the firearms officers.
5 Q. I'm not going to ask you about all the detail of those
6 because some of it of course is highly sensitive. In
7 broad terms, did those presentations include matters
8 such as the nature of the explosive devices you would be
9 looking at?
10 A. Yes, they did, sir.
11 Q. How to detect a suicide bomber, profiles developed from
12 other countries and so on?
13 A. It was information that we had gleaned from around the
14 world that we brought back to aid our own understanding.
15 Q. How an unarmed officer should react if he suspects that
16 somebody might be a suicide bomber?
17 A. Yes, sir.
18 Q. Command structures under these three different tactics?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Methods of intercepting people, on foot, in vehicles,
21 et cetera?
22 A. Yes, sir.
23 Q. I'm not going into the details of the tactics, but this
24 we have heard: we have heard that under both Kratos and
25 Clydesdale, there is only a positive indication under
11
1 those tactics that a critical shot, fatal shot, should
2 be administered if a suspect is positively identified
3 and is believed to be carrying a device; is that right?
4 A. That's correct, and it has to be a single decision from
5 the designated senior officer.
6 Q. So that's under Kratos and Clydesdale?
7 A. It's under Clydesdale, sir. There isn't any critical
8 shot decisions under Kratos People.
9 Q. I think you may be asked about that again, because
10 I think in some of the training documents under
11 Kratos People there was actually reference to critical
12 shots. But in any event, under those tactics, under
13 what your officers had been trained, a critical shot was
14 only suggested --
15 A. Yes, sir.
16 Q. -- if you were dealing with a positively identified
17 suspect who was believed to be carrying a device?
18 A. Yes, sir.
19 Q. Otherwise, is this right, officers were to fall back on
20 their normal training as firearms officers?
21 A. For most operations, especially around Kratos People, it
22 was always around the conventional firearms responses.
23 Thereafter, once the command structure came into place,
24 and a DSO was designated, then a decision could be made
25 based on the intelligence that was existing at that
12
1 time. If I can go back to what I said previously, that
2 if a designated senior officer was in place in relation
3 to the spontaneous events of a Kratos People, then that
4 designated senior officer could give an authorisation
5 for a critical shot if it was in those circumstances.
6 Q. So the same criteria apply --
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 Q. -- whichever tactic --
9 A. Yes, sir. I do apologise.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: So the fact that a DSO has been
11 appointed, does that give any indication as to what the
12 likely outcome is going to be?
13 A. Absolutely not, sir. The designated senior officer is
14 there for a function and that's a command
15 decision-making function, and all the specialist
16 firearms officers, all the ARV officers, know that they
17 are there as a decision-maker, because without that
18 officer being there, there can be no independent
19 decision -- there can be no actual decision that
20 a critical shot will be taken.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Right.
22 MR HOUGH: Now, were your officers also in the course of
23 this training warned that if they did believe somebody
24 was carrying a device, they were not to fire their
25 weapons at the central body mass, the torso?
13
1 A. That was information that we had obtained as a result of
2 experiences in other countries, that if a person is
3 carrying a body-borne device, then any rounds fired into
4 that is likely to detonate their device.
5 Q. Now, Operation Clydesdale, I think had specific code
6 words?
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 Q. To suggest that a particular response should be given in
9 certain circumstances?
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 Q. So is this right, that one of those code words dealt
12 with the situation where there was intelligence that
13 a particular person was a bomber and had a device?
14 A. Yes, sir.
15 Q. And that code word indicated that the officers should
16 fire a critical shot?
17 A. In Clydesdale, yes, sir.
18 Q. But there were no such code words for Kratos?
19 A. Not for Kratos People, no.
20 Q. Not for Kratos People; and perhaps you can tell us the
21 reason for them existing in Clydesdale and not in the
22 other?
23 A. The reasons that code words were put in was to aid the
24 decision-making process so that there could be no
25 misunderstanding of the officers on the ground exactly
14
1 what was being asked of them. In a fast-moving
2 situation, if you are talking a free speech on the
3 radio, there can be a possibility of misunderstanding.
4 So these code words were put in to make sure that the
5 officers understood what was being asked of them. They
6 would be code words and some free speech, just to make
7 sure.
8 Q. Just to be clear on this, why in Clydesdale and not in
9 Kratos Person?
10 A. Because Kratos Person was a spontaneous and the
11 responding officers wouldn't be trained to that level,
12 most likely. It would likely be ARVs that would be
13 responding to Kratos People as a spontaneous response.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I see, yes, because you have had no
15 time to pre-plan the deployment of specialist officers?
16 A. Exactly, sir.
17 MR HOUGH: We have heard that specialist firearms officers
18 take time to collect their equipment, be briefed and
19 taken down to a particular location.
20 A. Kratos People was all to do with fast-moving pieces of
21 intelligence coming in from the public, and the command
22 and the response to that.
23 Q. The DSO position, looking back historically, I think the
24 position of DSO had first been developed in public order
25 situations?
15
1 A. The concept had been, as a separate decision-maker, to
2 consider the information and the decision-making over
3 a specific set of circumstances. So it had been public
4 order and that had been in response to the use of baton
5 rounds or rubber bullets.
6 Q. That would be a senior officer who would have the final
7 responsibility for using that particular round?
8 A. Yes, sir.
9 Q. That particular equipment, yes. Then it was decided to
10 adapt that, use the same title for Clydesdale
11 situations?
12 A. Yes, because the principle was that somebody needed to
13 concentrate on the decision-making around the pieces of
14 intelligence that were coming in, so that that's what
15 they could concentrate on.
16 Q. So the idea was for the DSO to be able to focus, using
17 the intelligence they are getting, on that extremely
18 important decision of how to deal with the presentation
19 of the suicide terrorist?
20 A. Yes, that's correct, sir.
21 Q. We have heard from others, and I am sure you would
22 agree, that on 21 and 22 July you were dealing with
23 something entirely new?
24 A. It was really quite unprecedented, sir, yes.
25 Q. Failed suicide bombers?
16
1 A. Absolutely.
2 Q. In a sense, it had one element in common with Kratos,
3 because it was fast-moving?
4 A. It was a fast-moving -- it was a manhunt, yes, sir.
5 Q. But on the other hand it had some elements in common
6 with Clydesdale because it was intelligence led?
7 A. No, it had nothing to do with Clydesdale whatsoever,
8 sir.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It was about as far removed from
10 Clydesdale as it could possibly be?
11 A. Absolutely, sir. It was a policing operation. It was
12 a firearms policing and counter-terrorist operation to
13 find the failed bombers of 21 July, and I personally
14 wouldn't akin it to Clydesdale or Kratos.
15 MR HOUGH: So your officers were expected to use their
16 ordinary firearms training to deal with whatever
17 situation would present itself?
18 A. They always are, yes, but with the background knowledge
19 of exactly what they were dealing with, because they
20 were dealing with people responsible of trying to commit
21 suicide terrorism.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Would it be fair to put the essential
23 difference in this way: certainly with Clydesdale, you
24 had, as you say, a preconceived, a forecast situation.
25 A. Yes, sir.
17
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: So you knew what you were going to have
2 to deal with.
3 A. Yes.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: With Kratos, although it was
5 spontaneous, you were reacting to an understood
6 situation.
7 A. Yes.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Based on the information you had got.
9 A. Yes, sir.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Here, it was totally different because
11 what you were having to do was, as you described it
12 earlier, a manhunt.
13 A. Yes.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You were looking for people who you
15 didn't know where they were or what they might be doing?
16 A. When we came on duty on the 21st and the 22nd, we had
17 absolutely no idea what was going to happen, where the
18 intelligence would lead us, so it had to be
19 an intelligence-led firearms-supported operation.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Would you consider that Kratos or
21 Clydesdale had anything to do with this at all?
22 A. The only response it had was the separate response that
23 was being organised from information room that was being
24 run by Commander Carter and another tactical adviser.
25 That had to run simultaneously because if intelligence
18
1 started to come up, there would obviously be calls from
2 members of the public coming in on the 999 system, so
3 there had to be a response to deal with that. The
4 response in the information room was the response
5 organised.
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That information had to be fed to the
7 DSO eventually?
8 A. That DSO in the information room, yes.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: And in due course would be fed in to
10 any decision-making process once a suicide bomber had,
11 as it was thought, been identified?
12 A. Obviously if a piece of information came in from
13 a member of the public that Commander Carter started to
14 act on, and he thought it would have implications for
15 the operations that Commander Dick was -- then they
16 would communicate with each other, the tactical adviser
17 downstairs would be communicating with me, so I would
18 know what they were doing and they would know what we
19 were doing.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
21 MR HOUGH: So the main operation that we are hearing about
22 is run from the 16th floor room under Commander Dick
23 and, as you are telling us, that's not governed by
24 Kratos or Clydesdale?
25 A. No, sir.
19
1 Q. But then separately in the building, you have the
2 information room with Commander Carter, and they will
3 hear if a member of the public says that they suspect
4 there is a suicide bomber on Oxford Street, while
5 colleagues in the 16th floor room are dealing with
6 Scotia and Portnall roads?
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 Q. Now, although you have told us that Kratos and
9 Clydesdale had no application to these situations, would
10 you expect specialist firearms officers, if they heard
11 reference to a DSO or any discussion of a critical shot,
12 would you expect them to think back to their Kratos and
13 Clydesdale training?
14 A. Specialist firearms officers are highly trained. They
15 are very professional people. They always consider
16 everything. Whenever they are deploying, if they
17 deploy, then they will consider everything. If they
18 have had training in Kratos and Clydesdale, then those
19 tactics may migrate when they deploy, but they will deal
20 with the situation as it is faced before them. They
21 won't predesignate something in their head to say:
22 because a designated senior officer is present or
23 because we are dealing with this, this is what I am
24 dealing with. They will respond to the threat that is
25 faced before them.
20
1 Q. Moving on from that to July 2005. I think that you
2 yourself returned from annual leave around the middle of
3 July 2005?
4 A. Yes, I did, sir.
5 Q. On 21 July 2005, were you on duty as a tactical adviser
6 at Leman Street?
7 A. Yes, I was.
8 Q. We visited that, it's the CO19 base near Tower Hill?
9 A. That's correct, yes.
10 Q. Is this right, on that day you worked on the preparation
11 of a tactical options document for the operation that
12 was by then underway to find the failed bombers?
13 A. Yes, we had been contacted at Leman Street by
14 Superintendent Boutcher, who had asked for 24-hour
15 firearms cover for an operation that was emerging at
16 that time. He told us about the failed bombings, so
17 between myself and Andrew, we prepared a document that
18 could deal with all contingencies that may arise at that
19 time.
20 Q. At that time, I don't think it was known whether the
21 strategy to be followed would be a media appeal or
22 a series of covert operations against particular
23 addresses or anything else?
24 A. We had absolutely no idea, sir, no.
25 Q. Looking at the way you prepared this document with
21
1 Andrew, is this right, during the course of the
2 afternoon you communicated with each other by email?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. You put together the document, drawing on other
5 documents that you had over time?
6 A. As -- directly after the bombings on 7 July, that we had
7 started to prepare responses. We started to look at
8 tactics, as we had been doing over the years coming, and
9 so we had a number of documents already in place. These
10 documents were used as the base documents for this
11 tactical advice document.
12 Q. So there was a certain amount of cutting and pasting?
13 A. I wouldn't call it cutting and pasting; I would call it
14 using documents because they were relevant.
15 Q. I am just talking about the physical means rather than
16 demeaning the process. That document in its final form
17 dealt with a number of different situations?
18 A. It was intended to deal with a whole range of things
19 that could possibly emerge from ordinary suicide
20 terrorist tactics -- ordinary terrorist tactics to
21 suicide terrorist tactics.
22 Q. It dealt with premises and vehicles?
23 A. Yes, premises, vehicles, people.
24 Q. We have got an extract from that at tab 42 of the jury
25 bundle. You are seeing it on screen at the moment.
22
1 It's been redacted. Do you recognise that as part of
2 the document you wrote?
3 A. Yes, I do, sir.
4 Q. If we turn the page, we see the remaining options (b) to
5 (i), having seen (a) on the previous page?
6 A. Yes, sir.
7 Q. All those options existed for one particular situation?
8 A. This, the document was intended to be a base document,
9 a discussion document for any emerging intelligence that
10 could actually happen. I could have actually written
11 about 20 or 30 options at this particular time. If you
12 will see, the (a), (b) and (c) are stop options, and
13 each one, there is two for covert, for tactical support
14 teams and one for specialist firearms officers. It's
15 written in that way because that is the configuration
16 that the officers used at that time. The tactical
17 support teams could either be in plain clothes or they
18 could be a mixture of plain clothes and uniform, and
19 that then reflects in it.
20 The remaining six options, there is two for each
21 discipline, if you could call it: two for specialist
22 firearms officers, two for armed response vehicles and
23 two for tactical support teams, and the intention of
24 this was to headline to the police command that both
25 were able to use covert or overt resources.
23
1 It was a base document, a discussion document, sir.
2 Q. So summarising this, you have a document which has
3 a number of different sections?
4 A. Sir.
5 Q. Section 10 is the one that deals with suicide terrorists
6 specifically outside the premises, so spontaneous or
7 pre-planned?
8 A. Yes, sir. Or elsewhere.
9 Q. Or elsewhere?
10 A. Absolutely anywhere. It was intended for, as it says
11 just above 10, "Vehicle or Foot". That could be
12 a suicide terrorist who comes out on foot, or a suicide
13 terrorist that comes out on foot and then gets in
14 a vehicle.
15 Q. Then you set out under this particular section a menu of
16 options for the senior officers. The first three are
17 stop options; the next six are contain and challenge
18 options; and you are using as part of those options the
19 three parts of CO19, armed response vehicles?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. Which, as we have heard, are often overt?
22 A. Armed response vehicles are nearly always overt, sir.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You can recognise them? They are
24 recognisable?
25 A. Absolutely, sir.
24
1 MR HOUGH: So in all those options you have to be aware, the
2 senior officers have to be aware that it will be
3 an overt situation?
4 A. Yes. That was part of the discussions, to say that if
5 you are using armed response vehicles, then they are
6 highly trained officers, they are very competent
7 officers, but they are an overt response; and if this is
8 a covert operation, then we have to consider very
9 carefully how we deploy them.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Forgive me, Mr Hough, just before we
11 get too far away from it, we have not forgotten.
12 Looking at your heading for section 10 of this
13 document?
14 A. Yes, sir.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You explained to us that essentially
16 the situation you were having to deal with on the 21st
17 and 22nd was neither Clydesdale nor Kratos?
18 A. No, sir.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: But you do use the title "Kratos" in
20 the title of that section. Would you like to comment on
21 that?
22 A. Whether or not it had been downstairs using the armed
23 response vehicles from Commander Carter doing
24 a spontaneous Kratos, as a result of the intelligence
25 developing, then the armed response vehicles would use
25
1 these tactics and these were the options available. It
2 was just a headline document. So whether or not it
3 would be for this or for the spontaneous issues
4 downstairs, it is just headline. If it's spontaneous,
5 it's downstairs. If it would then become pre-planned,
6 it could be us --
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: By downstairs, you mean information
8 coming in.
9 A. I apologise, information room.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: In the information room.
11 A. Yes, sir.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Information coming in from the general
13 public?
14 A. Yes.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The development of what we have heard
16 called either Vivace or Theseus 2 was the product of
17 intelligence?
18 A. Yes, sir.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's the difference? Does it make
20 a difference?
21 A. Absolutely, because the operation,
22 Operation Theseus/Vivace, it was an intelligence-led
23 developing operation that Commander Boutcher was
24 running, and pieces of information would be coming in
25 all the time.
26
1 Spontaneous would be just a call from the member of
2 the public: "I have seen a person walking down the
3 street that I believe is a suicide terrorist".
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: And that is a true Kratos situation.
5 A. And that was very relevant because there were an awful
6 number of calls like that at that time, because members
7 of the public were obviously concerned with what was
8 going on at that time.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That was the result of 7/7?
10 A. Yes.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
12 MR HOUGH: This distinction between spontaneous and
13 pre-planned operations is one that pervades the firearms
14 manuals, the firearms authorisation documents and so on?
15 A. Yes, it does, sir.
16 Q. As we have heard from others, CO19 divided into three
17 parts: the ARV officers, then slightly more highly
18 trained -- I know we are dealing with all of them being
19 very highly trained -- slightly more highly trained than
20 the Tactical Support Team officers?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. And at the top the specialist firearms officers. We
23 have heard ARV officers almost always overt; Tactical
24 Support Team officers can be either?
25 A. Yes.
27
1 Q. Covert or overt. SFOs normally covert?
2 A. Normally covert. They can be overt if it's necessary.
3 Q. So your options involve the use of those different teams
4 individually or in combination?
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 Q. Under that document, and we have not looked at this
7 part, because parts of it are sensitive, you dealt with
8 the advantages and disadvantages of using each
9 particular option?
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 Q. We have heard, I think, that the document was presented
12 first to Mr Boutcher at about quarter to midnight by
13 Andrew?
14 A. As I understand.
15 Q. It was ultimately presented to other senior officers as
16 well?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. After you had produced that document, I think you
19 finished your duty at about 11 o'clock on the evening of
20 the 21st?
21 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
22 Q. When did you return to New Scotland Yard?
23 A. At 6 o'clock, approximately 6 o'clock the following
24 morning.
25 Q. Were you to take over as the oncall CO19 tactical
28
1 adviser from Andrew, who had held that role overnight?
2 A. I had arranged the previous night, as we had been
3 aligning resources that particular night, as who was
4 going to do what because we had to arrange for 24-hour
5 tactical advice cover for this operation, 24-hour
6 tactical advice cover for other operations, and for the
7 spontaneous Kratos response.
8 Q. As we have heard from Andrew, part of the job of the
9 tactical adviser on call is not just to provide tactical
10 advice to senior officers; it's also to make sure that
11 there are firearms resources for operations as they are
12 required?
13 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
14 Q. In the period between when you finished duty and when
15 you returned to New Scotland Yard, I think you made and
16 received a few calls; is that right?
17 A. Yes, I did.
18 Q. We have heard about these. It's tab 45 of the jury
19 bundle. If it can be brought up on screen it might
20 assist you. If you go down this to 5 o'clock in the
21 morning?
22 A. That's correct.
23 Q. Your name is coloured in a sort of light green where it
24 appears. Do you see a call there made by Andrew to you
25 but only lasting nine seconds?
29
1 A. What would be normal on the mornings is if we had
2 arranged the night before to provide 24-hour cover for
3 an operation, that the officer that had gone to bed or
4 gone home wouldn't know how that operation had
5 developed, so it's very usual, the first thing you do is
6 phone up your colleague who is going to take over to
7 say: what is the state of the operation; what is
8 happening; do I still have to come on to duty; has it
9 finished; or what do you want me to do? So that was the
10 purpose of those small couple of calls.
11 Q. Nine seconds suggests either a very, very brief call or
12 a phone message?
13 A. What actually happens is at that time I had very bad
14 reception in my bedroom, so what used to happen, it used
15 to ring, I used to answer it, I couldn't talk so I had
16 to go down into the kitchen. So then the conversations
17 carried on down there.
18 Q. I think you get down to the kitchen, if this sheet is
19 right, at 4 minutes past 5?
20 A. Something like that, yes, sir.
21 Q. You call Andrew back in a call lasting a minute and
22 a half or so?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. In the course of that call, what did he tell you?
25 A. I really can't remember now. It was just telling me
30
1 about that operation, about what was happening, state of
2 play.
3 Q. Can you recall now, and I'm not going to ask you about
4 the details of the call, because we understand that you
5 can't remember those, can you remember whether he was
6 talking in terms of an overt operation with a media
7 appeal or a covert operation looking at particular
8 addresses?
9 A. I can't remember the exact details. I just can't.
10 I know certain things happened after that, and I know
11 I know some things certain, but at that particular time
12 I couldn't tell you exactly what I knew.
13 Q. Later on at 5.58, we see you making a call to Andrew
14 which just lasts 15 seconds?
15 A. That's probably a call to him to let me into the secure
16 operations room that was on the 16th floor.
17 Q. So that gives us a time for your arrival. Then we have
18 you making a call at 20 past 6 to somebody not known.
19 Do you have any recollection of what that call might
20 have been?
21 A. That was a call to the tactical adviser that was
22 running, advising Mr Carter downstairs.
23 Q. Would that be Inspector ZAJ as we know him?
24 A. No, that was the officer that was taking over from him,
25 which I think was Chief Inspector Rush.
31
1 Q. I see. I think we can have that sheet off screen now.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Before you do, I noticed that I suspect
3 my copy of this document has been used to go on the
4 screen, because I recognise my writing on it, in
5 particular the "orange team leader" at 5.07, and also
6 it's disappeared at the moment, but there was a call
7 inserted, you will remember. I am sure I'm accurate but
8 I think everybody had better make sure that they know
9 where that has come from.
10 MR HOUGH: If we expand the screen, that's a reference to
11 the call from Alan to Inspector ZAJ and we heard
12 evidence about that.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It's got on to the screen, that's all.
14 It isn't, I think, the original document.
15 MR HOUGH: No, but they are both correct annotations.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I am glad to hear it. I am afraid I'm
17 going to go on doing this: the one at 6.20 was you to
18 the tactical adviser who had taken over from ZAJ.
19 A. Yes.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: We don't need to know his name, just
21 tactical adviser?
22 A. Yes.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
24 MR HOUGH: Now, you are arriving at just before 6 o'clock.
25 A. Sir.
32
1 Q. You have said that you were making that call to get into
2 the secure area?
3 A. It could have been to get into that secure area; it
4 could have been where are you in the building, because
5 it's a very large building; it was just to make contact
6 so that we could get together.
7 Q. Where did you get together?
8 A. In the control room on the 16th floor.
9 Q. Once you had got there, what kind of briefing did Andrew
10 give you?
11 A. He took me through the log that we had started -- that
12 he had started to prepare the night before, and
13 basically took me through all the information, where all
14 the teams were, what the deployments were, those issues.
15 Q. That log is at tab 41 of the jury bundle. I don't know
16 if you have either the jury bundle or a copy of the log
17 there?
18 A. I have a copy of the log here, sir.
19 Q. It's coming up on screen. If you can go to page 5 of
20 that, please. If you look at the screen, we know it's
21 Andrew's handwriting down to the end of the first half
22 of this page; is it your handwriting from there on?
23 A. It's from "22/7/2005 0600", that's my handwriting, sir.
24 Q. You are there recording that you assumed responsibility
25 as tactical adviser for Operation Vivace, the resources
33
1 for that operation?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. There you record Chief Inspector Rush, the person we
4 have just heard about, as the tactical adviser for
5 Mr Carter?
6 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
7 Q. You record that the orange team is with Inspector ZAJ,
8 who is to be relieved by Chief Inspector Terry?
9 A. That's correct.
10 Q. Were you told where the orange team was?
11 A. I knew that they were at Scotland Yard, sir, yes.
12 Q. Did you know where in Scotland Yard they were?
13 A. At that time, no, but I gathered there isn't many places
14 that a team can hold in Scotland Yard, so it would
15 probably have been in the canteen.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: In the canteen?
17 A. Probably, sir, yes.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Most likely place, anyway.
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 MR HOUGH: Then you record that the black team with their
21 tactical adviser Trojan 84 is to come on duty at
22 7 o'clock?
23 A. That's correct, sir.
24 Q. You would have understood that to be Leman Street?
25 A. Yes, sir.
34
1 Q. Then tactical support teams and armed response vehicle
2 to be the spontaneous response?
3 A. Yes. That would be from information room with
4 Commander Carter and the tac adviser.
5 Q. Were you made aware at that stage, when you first came
6 in and received your briefing from Andrew, what was
7 intended for those two teams, the orange and the black?
8 A. My understanding was that they were going to come on
9 duty and they were going to support this operation.
10 Q. Any specifics about where they might be going to support
11 the operation?
12 A. Not at that time, sir, no.
13 Q. I think we have heard actually that the black team,
14 although referred to repeatedly as the black team, was
15 a combination of parts of the black and green teams?
16 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
17 Q. You don't record in this document, and Andrew hasn't
18 recorded previously, who the Silver Commanders were to
19 be to lead those two teams. Was that something that was
20 mentioned to you at that stage?
21 A. No, it wasn't. I understood that there were Silver
22 Commanders within the building, but I wasn't aware that
23 there were to be any deployments at that time.
24 Q. Were you told who those Silver Commanders, as it were,
25 on duty and available were?
35
1 A. I knew that the deputy SIO was Angie Scott, and there
2 were other trained officers within that building.
3 Q. We will move up the page. We see Andrew has recorded
4 much earlier that morning, about 2.30, that DI Scott was
5 the night duty Silver Commander and DI Neil Smith was to
6 be the early turn Silver Commander?
7 A. That's what's written there, sir, yes.
8 Q. Did you understand those to be oncall Silver Commanders,
9 should they be required for these two teams?
10 A. That's my understanding, sir, yes.
11 Q. If we go back down the page, now, this is the
12 information you received before the meeting with
13 Commander McDowall; we have also heard that you make the
14 call at 6.20 to Mr Rush, I think?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. So again, that's before the meeting with
17 Commander McDowall?
18 A. Yes, sir.
19 Q. Then we see further down the page, you timing it at
20 6.48, a meeting in the 15th floor conference room with
21 commanders McDowall, Allison, Carter and others?
22 A. That second entry is an entry that refers to two
23 meetings, and the 6.48 timing is a time that I wrote;
24 whether it's the time that I first got to the first
25 meeting or a time that I recorded at that meeting,
36
1 I don't know.
2 Q. When you went to the meeting, where was it taking place?
3 A. In Commander McDowall's office on the 15th floor.
4 Q. Because we have heard that it, as it were, started in
5 that office and then moved to a wider audience in the
6 conference room?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. So you were there for the first part of that?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Was the meeting already underway, were people already
11 there and talking when you arrived?
12 A. There were people there. There were people talking.
13 I don't know what state the meeting was at at that time.
14 Q. You went there, I think, with Andrew?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. There you record:
17 "Informed to halt the overt strategy".
18 So before this meeting took place, were you aware
19 whether the overt strategy of a media appeal rather than
20 covert surveillance supported by firearms at particular
21 addresses, whether that overt strategy was still being
22 used?
23 A. I knew that there was some developing intelligence
24 around some addresses at that time. And I knew that
25 some work was being done at those addresses. But
37
1 whether or not -- I don't know what was in Mr McDowall's
2 mind prior to me coming to that meeting.
3 Q. In your most recent witness statement, it's the last
4 paragraph, you say:
5 "After meeting with Commander McDowall [that's this
6 meeting] I understood that a public appeal would not be
7 made that morning, but rather it would be a covert
8 operation involving the deployment of surveillance and
9 armed support to particular addresses arising from
10 intelligence that had arisen overnight."
11 A. That's the summary of my thoughts at that time, sir,
12 yes.
13 Q. So you had heard something about developing intelligence
14 before the meeting, but you weren't aware that the overt
15 strategy had been called off until this meeting?
16 A. No.
17 Q. The intelligence you did become aware of beforehand, who
18 told you about that?
19 A. I can't remember exactly who told me, but I was aware of
20 an address, and I was aware of other emerging
21 intelligence in relation to other addresses.
22 Q. Now -- go on?
23 A. Sorry.
24 Q. It's all right.
25 A. Being in the control room at 1600, I may have heard it
38
1 from -- Andrew may have told me, I may have heard it
2 from somebody else in there, it may have been written up
3 on a board. I don't know now, but I know that there
4 were addresses being researched and work being done
5 around addresses.
6 Q. Andrew has given evidence that he certainly wasn't aware
7 of moving to a covert strategy or focusing on specific
8 addresses until this meeting?
9 A. No, I did know before that.
10 Q. Before this meeting, were you told of any decision that
11 the orange team which was at Scotland Yard was being
12 kept there, deliberately kept in a central location, so
13 that it might go to any number of possible locations?
14 A. That would be the normal thing to do. That would be the
15 sensible thing to do. I am aware of one address in one
16 side of London and I am aware of intelligence in
17 relation to other addresses; it just wouldn't make sense
18 to me to send them to one location if there was a lot of
19 other pieces of information emerging at that time.
20 Q. Might that depend on whether you have one address or two
21 addresses or three addresses when the decision is first
22 made about deployment?
23 A. At that time, that particular team, orange team, had
24 been a standby team for a number of operations
25 previously to that. There was nothing unusual for this,
39
1 for them to be taken to a central location and say:
2 right, hold here, please, because there is a lot of
3 things developing, we don't know what we are going to do
4 with you yet, until everything firms up, then we will
5 send you out to a location when we know what's
6 happening.
7 Q. Were you aware whether anybody had actually sat down and
8 made that decision before 7 o'clock that morning?
9 A. I didn't believe that there were any deployments at that
10 time.
11 Q. So is the answer no?
12 A. Yes, sir.
13 Q. Going on down the note, after you have been informed
14 that the overt strategy was to be halted, the
15 intelligence was detailed, so more information provided
16 about the intelligence?
17 A. Yes, I think that relates to the main briefing.
18 Q. I see.
19 A. Because at that main briefing, we were actually told
20 about four possible addresses, four possible vehicles,
21 which then made sense to me to say at that time: I have
22 got one team, I need to hold them at a central location.
23 Q. And those addresses as far as you recall, obviously
24 Scotia and Portnall?
25 A. Yes.
40
1 Q. Blair House and Corfe House?
2 A. Corfe House.
3 Q. Moving on, Silver for orange, DI Merrick Rose, who will
4 brief orange at New Scotland Yard?
5 A. That's correct. At that meeting the Silvers are
6 actually nominated for specific addresses.
7 Q. We heard from Mr Rose yesterday about how they were
8 nominated, him being selected and Mr Purser coming
9 forward.
10 If we can turn the page, please, on screen:
11 "Black to New Scotland Yard for briefing with
12 Silver".
13 Is that indicating that the black team was going to
14 come from Leman Street to New Scotland Yard to be
15 briefed by Mr Purser?
16 A. I think that's actually a separate entry. It may be
17 made at a separate time. I can't remember now. It
18 could have been one entry; it could have been separate;
19 I could have made that one when I got back to the
20 control room. It makes sense that I would make it back
21 to the control room, because I wouldn't know who the
22 surveillance team leaders were while I was in that
23 meeting.
24 Q. Then you record:
25 "As soon as all teams briefed, both out to support
41
1 surveillance teams."
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. You record the tactical advisers for each team?
4 A. Yes, sir.
5 Q. I think that can come off screen for the moment.
6 At that time, when you had just come out of that
7 meeting, where did you expect the black team to go from
8 New Scotland Yard?
9 A. In relation to what, sir?
10 Q. You have got the black team coming into New Scotland
11 Yard to be briefed; where did you expect them to go from
12 there; did you know where they would be going from
13 there?
14 A. I knew that they had to come in. I knew that they had
15 to be briefed. I made a phone call to their tactical
16 adviser so that they could arrange to pick up the
17 Silver.
18 Q. Did you know where they would be going, whether to
19 a particular police station, to a holding point,
20 anything like that?
21 A. No.
22 Q. Did you know about the Territorial Army Centre at all?
23 A. At that time, I don't know if I was aware of it at that
24 time, but it would be a normal thing to do, that the
25 teams would go to a holding area -- that the teams would
42
1 go to a briefing area and then that team would assess
2 where they should go to be close to the address that
3 they need to cover.
4 Q. We shall hear that you gave the directions to the
5 tactical adviser with the team, so I am obviously just
6 exploring what you knew at this stage. You knew that
7 they were going to be deployed to Scotia Road?
8 A. Yes, sir.
9 Q. But you didn't know which police station they would be
10 going to?
11 A. In relation to?
12 Q. In relation to Scotia Road, near Scotia Road.
13 A. They may not go to a police station. As it happens,
14 they went to Nightingale Lane for a briefing, which is
15 a briefing area which is commonly used by firearms
16 officers for briefings, because it's a safe location.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Is that a decision that is left to the
18 Silver?
19 A. It normally is, sir. My instructions to the tactical
20 adviser on the ground is to say: right, this is your
21 role, this is your function; you are to support
22 surveillance teams at Scotia Road, you need to pick up
23 your Silver and you need to give them a briefing. So
24 they will go to a suitable location to do that briefing.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It's up to Silver and the team leader,
43
1 I suppose, as to where they go?
2 A. Yes, sir, and once they have done that, they then report
3 back to me to say: right, we are done, we are briefed,
4 we are ready to go.
5 MR HOUGH: When you come out of this meeting, have you been
6 informed by Mr McDowall and others of the strategy
7 that's to be followed at these addresses?
8 A. I was aware of the strategy, yes.
9 Q. What was that strategy as you recall it?
10 A. That CO19 would stop all known subjects coming out of
11 the buildings.
12 Q. Out of the buildings or out of the addresses?
13 A. Well, out of the addresses, because I knew that
14 Portnall Road was a flat, and I knew that Scotia Road
15 was a multi-occupancy building.
16 Q. Did you know that at the time of the meeting with
17 Mr McDowall?
18 A. I think I did, yes.
19 Q. Did you discuss in that meeting or raise any questions
20 about how the strategy was to be followed, given that
21 you were dealing with a block with a communal entrance?
22 A. It would be normal practice that surveillance controls
23 the addresses. Firearms team would locate at a location
24 that would remain covert because that is of ultimate
25 importance here. As the subject is coming out of the
44
1 addresses, if it's identified, then firearms will latch
2 on to the back of that, and do an interception as and
3 when it was instructed by the designated senior officer.
4 So that's where they would locate.
5 Q. Was there any discussion at that meeting about who would
6 make the identification and who would ask the SFO team
7 to intercept a particular person?
8 A. The person responsible for the identification is the
9 surveillance team. The person who is responsible for
10 the decision-making is the DSO.
11 Q. Was that discussed in the meeting, or is that just
12 something that you have concluded based on your
13 extensive experience after the --
14 A. I don't know whether that was discussed at the meeting.
15 There was an awful lot of stuff discussed at the meeting
16 and after, and it's very difficult to say what was
17 discussed exactly when, because ...
18 Q. But you think, is this right, that you were aware of the
19 fact that Scotia Road was a communal block while at that
20 meeting?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Or when coming out of it?
23 A. (Witness nods).
24 Q. From the meeting, where did you go?
25 A. I went back to the control room.
45
1 Q. On the 16th floor?
2 A. Yes. I may have had some meetings with some other
3 people, at other times, because I know I spoke to
4 an awful lot of people that morning, but I have no
5 recollection; and I know that I then went back to the
6 control room to start aligning resources, to start
7 organising things, making phone calls and getting some
8 support in the control room.
9 Q. I think you made a call to Trojan 84, the tactical
10 adviser --
11 A. That's correct.
12 Q. -- for the black team at 7 minutes past 8?
13 A. Yes, I made an awful lot of calls that morning, some on
14 my mobile phone, an awful lot on the landline that was
15 there, because most of the time I was sitting at the
16 desk and it was far easier to use that landline.
17 Q. You, I think, have produced your mobile phone records to
18 the IPCC?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. They show that there was a call at 7 minutes past 8 made
21 by you on your mobile to Trojan 84 lasting three
22 minutes?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. Can you tell us where you were when you were making that
25 call and what was the subject of the call?
46
1 A. I would have been in the control room and it would have
2 been about the meeting, what they were to do, where they
3 were to go, what the strategy was, about the
4 intelligence, and the fact that they now needed to come
5 to Scotland Yard to pick up their Silver.
6 Q. So those instructions are given at 7 minutes past 8 and
7 you were in the control room at 7 minutes past 8?
8 A. To the best of my knowledge, sir, yes.
9 Q. I think he called you back for a very, very short call
10 at about 16 minutes past 8; do you recall what that call
11 was about? We can show on the screen a statement in
12 which he makes reference to that statement, if you would
13 like?
14 A. I thought you were talking about the call at 7.15, sir.
15 Q. No, at the moment I am talking about one rather later.
16 A. Sorry. I totally misunderstood you. I thought you were
17 referring to the 508 call at 7.15.
18 Q. Let us get these two calls separate, then.
19 A. Sorry.
20 Q. Quarter past 7, there is a call from you to Trojan 84?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Lasting five minutes?
23 A. Yes, sir.
24 Q. What was said in that call?
25 A. What we just talked about, about what they were doing,
47
1 to come -- had to come and pick up their Silver, all
2 those issues.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That was instructions about the
4 deployment generally?
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 MR HOUGH: So they are given the instructions about the
7 deployment at 7.15.
8 Then at 7 minutes past 8, you are out of the meeting
9 with Mr McDowall, you are back into the control room; is
10 that right?
11 A. Yes, sir.
12 Q. There is another call from you to Trojan 84?
13 A. 8.07, yes, sir.
14 Q. At 7 minutes past 8 lasting three minutes?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Recalling those two calls, and I know it can be hard to
17 separate things at this distance of time, can you recall
18 what that call was about?
19 A. No, I can't, sir. No, I really can't.
20 Q. That's fine.
21 A. I made so many calls that morning, some on the landline,
22 some on a mobile phone. The details of that call I just
23 can't remember.
24 Q. So you have given them their instructions at 7.15; the
25 meeting with Mr McDowall in the main control room, does
48
1 that continue after you have given your instructions?
2 A. Sorry, could you ...
3 Q. Let us go back to taking it in order. You have arrived
4 at New Scotland Yard at 6 o'clock; you have had your
5 instructions, briefing from Andrew?
6 A. Yes, sir.
7 Q. You have gone to Mr McDowall's office and from there to
8 the conference room?
9 A. Yes, sir.
10 Q. You have made the call at 7.15?
11 A. Yes, sir.
12 Q. -- to Trojan 84 to give the instructions on the
13 deployment?
14 A. That's correct, yes.
15 Q. At some point after that you go to the control room?
16 A. (Witness nods)
17 Q. Around what time would that have been?
18 A. It must have been after that meeting, so 7.00, 7.20.
19 After that meeting finished, I spoke to some people, and
20 then just went down to the control room to carry on
21 about the business.
22 Q. While you were in the control room, do you recall
23 a meeting taking place in the forward intelligence cell?
24 A. Yes, I do. I think that was a meeting called by the
25 DSO, Commander Dick.
49
1 Q. Were you present in that meeting?
2 A. Yes, there were a number of officers present.
3 Q. Were you present throughout that meeting?
4 A. Yes. Yes, I recall it was a fairly short, sharp
5 meeting.
6 Q. In the course of that meeting, what did Commander Dick
7 say about the strategy to be followed?
8 A. I don't know, I can't remember her exact words, but she
9 outlined what the strategy was, or what the operational
10 intention was; and that was for the stopping of people
11 coming out of the premises, who would do the stopping,
12 done on her orders, and her decisions.
13 Q. Did she say anything about the fact that it was
14 a communal block and that Mr McDowall's strategy might
15 have to be adapted because of that fact?
16 A. I can't remember, but I do remember the fact that --
17 what our role was in this, because it was quite clear,
18 and she made that quite clear. I can only assume that
19 she knew at that time that it was a communal block,
20 because I did.
21 Q. Was there any discussion at that time about the fact
22 that people had already come out of the block?
23 A. That is a recollection, but the details of it I don't
24 know, sir.
25 Q. Was there any discussion as far as you can recall -- you
50
1 may not because it's a detail -- about what had been
2 done with those people, I think two people, and why?
3 A. No, I don't, sir.
4 Q. Were you aware in the course of that meeting or
5 afterwards about an SO13 arrest team under
6 a Mr Dingemans being sent to Leman Street?
7 A. I knew that there was an arrest team because that is
8 always a normal process, that if you have a firearms
9 team out operating on the ground, whatever happens, if
10 they did an interception, if they did a stop, if they
11 deployed, then the person that had been detained would
12 be handed over to investigators. I believe that was one
13 of their functions.
14 Q. So typically you would have a CO19 team to detain
15 somebody, using firearms?
16 A. Yes, sir.
17 Q. Then once that person's been detained, they are then
18 seen by the arrest team, who are investigators, who
19 actually talk to them and gather intelligence from them?
20 A. Yes, that's correct, sir.
21 Q. What information did Commander Dick give you about what
22 the CO19 team would be doing, and when they might be
23 wanted at Scotia Road?
24 A. I believe she wanted them there as soon as possible,
25 once they had been properly briefed and properly
51
1 organised. So that would have been normal, that
2 Commander Dick would accept that the teams have to be
3 briefed, they have to be organised properly, and they
4 have to get into place. There is a need for speed, but
5 you need to do it properly and you need to do it in
6 an organised way, and I am sure Commander Dick accepted
7 that.
8 Q. We have heard that this meeting took place some time
9 shortly after 8 o'clock. At that time, did you know
10 where Trojan 84 and the black team were?
11 A. They were either at Leman Street on their way to
12 Nightingale Lane or at Nightingale Lane. I can't
13 remember where. I would have been in constant contact
14 with Trojan 84 because that was my role and he would
15 have been phoning me. Whether that was these phone
16 calls, I don't know. But they would have been on the
17 landline as well, because I would have not only been
18 contacting him, I would have been contacting the other
19 teams that were dealing with Portnall Road.
20 Q. When did you first become aware that they were going to
21 Nightingale Lane to receive their briefing?
22 A. Again I don't know, but it was nothing unusual to me
23 that they would be going to a location for a briefing
24 that would be south of London. Leman Street is north of
25 London. If they are going to have a deployment in
52
1 South London, then they would want to come to a briefing
2 location closer to their point of deployment.
3 Q. Were you involved in the decision about where their
4 holding area might be, where they might wait for their
5 instructions after they had been briefed and sent out?
6 A. I was aware of the TA Centre there, and I was aware of
7 some phone calls that -- I made some phone calls and
8 spoke to Trojan 84. Whether or not I told him about
9 that, I may have discussed it with him, but then...
10 Q. Is this right, in this early period in the control room,
11 you are communicating with Trojan 84, you are receiving
12 information about his location?
13 A. Yes, sir.
14 Q. You are also receiving and imparting information about
15 where they are going to brief, where they are going to
16 hold up, when they might be expected there?
17 A. Yes, sir. That would be the normal course of events.
18 Q. Now, can we just have a plan of the control room on
19 screen? It's tab 20 of the jury bundle. We have heard
20 from others about where you positioned yourself in this
21 room, but just to hear it from the horse's mouth, where
22 do you recall sitting or standing in the period between,
23 say, 8 o'clock and 9.30?
24 A. Around about between where A3 and A4 is on the back row
25 of the operations room.
53
1 Q. Were you normally sitting or standing?
2 A. Both. If I was on the phone, I would be sitting. If
3 I was writing I would be sitting. If I was looking at
4 my computer I would have been sitting. But then I did
5 walk around the room and speak to other officers.
6 Q. We have heard from others that Commander Dick was
7 normally standing with a number of other senior officers
8 around her?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Where were they?
11 A. At what time, sir?
12 Q. Just generally, which area were they standing in or were
13 they just everywhere?
14 A. It depends what was happening.
15 Q. We will come to particular moments. What was the
16 atmosphere and the general noise level in the room?
17 A. There were a lot of people in the room.
18 Q. Roughly what number during this period?
19 A. I have got absolutely no idea, sir. But it was
20 a working environment. There were people talking, there
21 were people on the phone, there were people calling to
22 each other to get things done. It was a normal
23 operation room managing a crime in action.
24 Q. Did you sometimes have to call to be heard across the
25 room?
54
1 A. No more than I do normally, sir, no.
2 Q. You said you compared it to a crime in action?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. Would the atmosphere in a crime in action operations
5 room be rather different from what, say, a surveillance
6 officer would be used to in a lifestyle surveillance
7 operation?
8 A. Absolutely, sir. Well, it really depends on what stage
9 it's at. If it's a quiet time, then it's normally
10 quiet. If there is a lot going on, then there is a lot
11 of people speaking, but if you are dealing just with
12 a very slow-time intelligence-gathering operation, where
13 there is just one or two people in the room, then it
14 naturally will be very quiet. But this was a perfectly
15 normal environment for me to work in, sir.
16 Q. You have told us about the DSO role in general terms,
17 and you have told us about how in public order
18 situations and in Operation Clydesdale situations, the
19 DSO was really required for that final decision about
20 what to do when presented with the particular threat?
21 A. Not only at the final time but throughout, options and
22 choices and decisions based on advice that was given.
23 Q. Were you under the impression that Commander Dick was
24 limiting her role to a specific aspect of the operation,
25 or was she just in charge of the whole business of the
55
1 operations room?
2 A. To my mind, the DSO is there to deal with the arrest
3 function of people who were identified. The
4 investigation of this is being dealt with by somebody
5 totally separate.
6 Q. Who would that be?
7 A. In this, I think it was Superintendent Boutcher.
8 Q. Your role was as the tactical adviser to the DSO?
9 A. Yes, sir.
10 Q. That, I think, would involve providing expert firearms
11 advice?
12 A. Providing advice about what options are available, what
13 resources are available and the capabilities of those
14 resources.
15 Q. You also, I think, had the function as part of that of
16 communicating with the firearms team through their
17 tactical adviser on the ground?
18 A. Yes. I advised the designated senior officer on what is
19 available. The officers on the ground, that would have
20 been Trojan 84 and the other tactical advisers, and then
21 other tactical advisers for operations to come, offer
22 specific advice to the on-the-ground Silver and link in
23 with me.
24 Q. What was your method of communicating with Trojan 84,
25 the tactical adviser to the black team?
56
1 A. By phone, sir.
2 Q. Landline or mobile?
3 A. By both.
4 Q. You were asked in your interview by the IPCC whether you
5 had a direct telephone link to Trojan 84, and you said:
6 "No, I had a mobile phone link to him."
7 For those who are following it, it's page 301. Do
8 you recall saying that?
9 A. No, I don't. But if I obviously did say it --
10 Q. Did you prefer mobile over landline?
11 A. It depends where I was in the room. Landline is
12 normally a better -- you can speak to somebody a little
13 better, but you are limited if you use a landline by the
14 length of the wire attached to the desk, that if you
15 need to move around, sometimes it's better by mobile
16 phone.
17 Q. In that period when you are first in the control room
18 after 8 o'clock, in fact between 8 o'clock and
19 9 o'clock, four people came out of the block at
20 Scotia Road. Were you aware of each and every one of
21 those coming out?
22 A. No, I wasn't, sir.
23 Q. Were you aware of any of them coming out?
24 A. I knew that people came out, but unless they had been
25 identified as people that would require an intervention,
57
1 then it wouldn't be my role.
2 Q. If people are coming out and decisions are being made
3 about them in the control room, is that something that
4 you would have been aware of simply by being in the
5 control room?
6 A. My function is to offer tactical advice. Yes, I am part
7 of that team because I am close to the designated senior
8 officer and I am close to the SIO, Mr Boutcher, but
9 decisions as to who is stopped is -- that's not my
10 function. I am there to offer advice on how they could
11 be stopped.
12 Q. Who was making those decisions?
13 A. In relation to?
14 Q. Who was to be stopped.
15 A. Either the designated senior officer and -- together
16 with the SIO.
17 Q. Do you recall her making those decisions about the
18 people who came out between 8 o'clock and 9 o'clock?
19 A. No, no, I don't, sir.
20 Q. Now, Trojan 84 has made a witness statement in which he
21 has said that you told him that some people had come out
22 of the address and had been eliminated?
23 A. Yes, sir.
24 Q. Is that something others in the control room told you?
25 A. As I said, I was aware that people had come out, but
58
1 they weren't a job for CO19, therefore they had been
2 eliminated, so I just passed that information on to
3 Trojan 84.
4 Q. Did you assume that they had been eliminated by
5 Commander Dick or by somebody else?
6 A. They were just not the subjects that we were looking for
7 that morning.
8 Q. Did you know who had eliminated them?
9 A. No, I didn't, sir, no.
10 Q. Did a time come when you had some concerns passed to you
11 by a Silver firearms liaison officer whom we are calling
12 Nick?
13 A. Mm.
14 Q. What were those concerns?
15 A. Sorry?
16 Q. I thought you were indicating yes.
17 A. No, no.
18 Q. Do you have any recollection of a conversation with
19 a Silver firearms liaison officer, quite a junior
20 officer, we are calling Nick?
21 A. Erm --
22 Q. He was also seated in the back row?
23 A. I had a lot of conversations with a lot of people about
24 a lot of things.
25 Q. The evidence he gives is about a relatively important
59
1 conversation, so I am going to just tell you about what
2 his evidence was so that it might jog your memory.
3 A. Thank you, sir.
4 Q. He says that he came over to your seat at about 8.30 and
5 passed on to you three concerns from the red
6 surveillance team leader. First of all, a concern that
7 the specialist firearms officer team was too far away;
8 secondly, that a concern that the buses in the area were
9 still running and that a suspect might be able to get on
10 to the transport system; and thirdly, a concern that
11 because this was a communal door, there was confusion on
12 the ground about what to do with people who were coming
13 out who were not believed to be the suspects, the
14 subjects.
15 Do you recall that conversation at all?
16 A. I recall it now because I have been told about it.
17 I don't actually remember the specific conversation, but
18 I remember -- I know that the issues are issues that
19 have been discussed.
20 Q. Were they issues that were being discussed around that
21 time, 8.30 in the morning on that day?
22 A. The bus stop issue was one that Commander Dick had made
23 a decision about, that they weren't going to be stopped,
24 and that is her decision.
25 Q. What time was that decision, as far as you recall?
60
1 A. I really don't know, sir. The issue of who was going to
2 do the stops was clear to me, and it's my understanding
3 that it was clear to everybody else in the room that if
4 it was an identified subject, then it would be CO19 that
5 did the stop. If it was not one of the subjects, then
6 it would be an unarmed officer or another resource that
7 would do that stop.
8 Q. Nick has told us that you gave three responses, and I'll
9 take you through them to see if you remember these
10 either being responses you gave or being the kind of
11 responses you would have given, given what you knew.
12 First of all he says that you told him that in
13 response to the concern about the team being too far
14 away, that the Territorial Army Centre was being recced.
15 Do you recall either saying that or knowing that?
16 A. That's my understanding, because I know now that it was,
17 and I probably knew it at that time, because I know now
18 that Trojan 84 had instructed the team leader to
19 research that. Whether that had originally come from me
20 down to him and then back, I don't know. But again,
21 that's normal process, that if somebody says that
22 a location is suitable, then we can't take that on face
23 value. The firearms team actually have to go down and
24 look at it to see if it is suitable for a holding area
25 for a number of reasons.
61
1 Q. He has also told us that you indicated that the bus
2 stop, at least a bus stop, had in fact been suspended?
3 A. No, because I knew Commander Dick had not suspended the
4 bus stops.
5 Q. So you think he is wrong about that?
6 A. (Witness nods)
7 Q. Then thirdly, he says that you indicated that CO19 would
8 stop everyone coming from the addresses?
9 A. No, that's -- no. CO19 were only ever to stop
10 identified subjects.
11 Q. He's also given evidence that you checked each answer
12 with Commander Dick, who is actually standing nearby.
13 Any recollection of that?
14 A. Absolutely none, because if I had checked it with her,
15 she would have said, "No, that's not the case".
16 Q. I think you had a loggist called Callum, who commenced
17 his log -- Callum is obviously a pseudonym -- at 20 to 9
18 that morning?
19 A. When I first got into the control room, I knew that we
20 had a number of addresses, I knew that we had a number
21 of firearms teams and that was then going to develop
22 during the day. I needed some support in there. What
23 I wanted was an officer to make phone calls, jot things
24 down, do whatever I asked them to do so that I could
25 concentrate on giving tactical advice. He made
62
1 a written record of that. I wouldn't call it a log,
2 sir.
3 Q. I see. His written record, I think, starts at page 349
4 of the documents, and there is a copy for the jury which
5 will be handed out and which can go in, I think, tab 56
6 of the jury bundle. (Handed). While he was making this
7 record, was Callum normally near you?
8 A. Callum was normally sat next to me at the back row, and
9 that's probably where he remained all day.
10 Q. Even when you were standing up and moving around?
11 A. Yes.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Another divider?
13 MR HOUGH: Divider 56, I think, is the next one.
14 Going through those entries, he has recorded at 8.40
15 "composite black and green team deploying", he says
16 there "Larkhall Lane"?
17 A. That's a mistake, I think he means Nightingale Lane.
18 Q. Then 8.45:
19 "Stated intention. Any identified subject from
20 Scotia Road address to be detained or [it is probably]
21 anybody going to the known vehicle Nissan Primera ..."
22 That's the Primera we have heard about is associated
23 with one of the suspects?
24 A. Yes. What that would be is that his note of that and my
25 talking to him and me saying to him: okay, we need to
63
1 get that out to the units on the ground. Whether he did
2 it at that time or not, this is just his notes.
3 Q. So his note of you saying that any identified subject is
4 going to be detained?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Moving down the page, 8.50:
7 "Stated intention as above to Trojan 84".
8 A. Yes, and that would either have been him calling
9 Trojan 84 or me calling Trojan 84 and him just making
10 a record of it, the fact that that's what I have told
11 them.
12 Q. Passing on the intention set out?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Then 8.52:
15 "SO19 team to deploy to TA Centre, local area to
16 Scotia Road".
17 Do you recall what was being discussed at that time?
18 A. That would have been to deploy to a closer holding area.
19 Q. So --
20 A. Because at the early part of the day, if you are running
21 this operation when it's very quiet, you could probably
22 hold at Nightingale Lane, and then still get to
23 a location within a specified time. As traffic then
24 starts to build up and it gets busier, then you need to
25 come to closer holding locations.
64
1 Q. Are you saying that an actual decision was taken that
2 morning initially to hold at Nightingale Lane when the
3 roads between there and Scotia Road would have been
4 quieter, or do you think that would just be sensible
5 practice?
6 A. It's sensible practice. It may have been a decision
7 made by Trojan 84 and the team leader, but it wasn't
8 a decision that was weighed by me. But it is sensible,
9 normal practice and that's what would normally go on.
10 Q. You don't know if in fact they had decided to hold at
11 Nightingale Lane, or if they had just decided to get to
12 the TA Centre as soon as they could?
13 A. No, sir.
14 Q. Going down, 8.54, reference to Trojan 80; that must be
15 a mistake?
16 A. It refers to explosives officer, sir.
17 Q. Yes. I think the reason for this mistake is that
18 somebody has seen "expo" and thought "Espo", the first
19 letters of your name?
20 A. Yes. No, sir, its ATO, armaments technical officer.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What should be there, in fact, "Espo"?
22 A. No, it's "ATO", sir.
23 MR HOUGH: "Expo" in the place where "TJ80" is.
24 "Deployed to DR"?
25 A. Harrow Road, sir. That was in relation to the
65
1 Portnall Road address.
2 Q. Then 8.56:
3 "Bus stop at Scotia Road suspended."
4 A. Yes, sir.
5 Q. Can you help us with this? Do you have any idea why
6 Callum might have written this?
7 A. No, I have read this since and it's just incorrect, sir.
8 Q. Going down the page, another reference to an explosives
9 officer at 9 o'clock now to go to Nightingale Lane?
10 A. Sir, yes.
11 Q. Then 9.04, "SO11 controls", now, that is --
12 A. Again, it's a mistake. I think he meant SO12. It's
13 just another group that did surveillance, sir.
14 Q. I suppose it could be SCD11, which is the other
15 surveillance branch?
16 A. Now it is. I think at that time they were SO11.
17 I think they have changed their name as a lot of other
18 people did.
19 Q. It's in any event a reference to other surveillance
20 officer controls to make contact with Silvers to discuss
21 control of the front doors of both addresses?
22 A. Yes, that will be normal practice that the tactical
23 advisers on the ground, that would be both Trojan 84 and
24 the one at Portnall Road, would link in with their
25 surveillance controllers, tell them where they are, tell
66
1 them what they are doing, so that if anything happened,
2 any eventualities, then they could make contact and
3 could deploy. It's just good practice, sir.
4 Q. Can we turn over the page, please. An entry for 9.06:
5 "Any persons from either known address, covert stop
6 in manner to status ie female with children or male with
7 rucksack. All stops to be conducted with SO19."
8 Can you interpret that for us?
9 A. I think that Callum is just making reference here to if
10 a subject comes out of the known address, that we may
11 stop women and children or we would stop women and
12 children in a different way than we would stop a known
13 subject. If they had come out of the actual address,
14 then they would still be subjects and still have to be
15 dealt with in an appropriate way.
16 Q. Just to be clear on this before we break, you say here:
17 "All stops to be conducted with SO19".
18 A. That's from subject addresses, sir.
19 Q. So how would it be known that somebody had come out of
20 21 Scotia Road?
21 A. It wouldn't, sir.
22 Q. So how do you decide who stops a woman with a child?
23 A. That would be designated senior officer, I would -- for
24 Scotia Road, because as we couldn't tell who was
25 actually going to come out of the front door of the
67
1 actual premises, there was only control of the communal
2 at that time, then the decision would be the designated
3 senior officer and it would probably be just identified
4 subjects. Whether or not this reference is made more to
5 Portnall Road than to Scotia Road, I don't know, sir.
6 Q. It says "either known address", doesn't it?
7 A. Yes, but it's just a brief entry in relation to the way
8 that CO19 would normally do stops, that they would be
9 proportionate to the risk and proportionate to the type
10 of person that they were dealing with.
11 Q. We heard Commander Dick refer to a high risk stop; is
12 that something you are familiar with?
13 A. It's -- all armed stops are high risk, sir. It depends
14 on what you are dealing with and the intelligence that
15 you are dealing with at that time.
16 Q. Is this right, as far as you were concerned, anybody
17 thought to come out of the specific address --
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. -- was to be stopped using SFO firearms officers?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. But the DSO would decide whether any particular person
22 merited a stop at all?
23 A. Yes. The DSO would make any decision anyway,
24 irrespective of whether or not it was a known subject or
25 not. She was the decision-maker on that morning.
68
1 MR HOUGH: Perhaps that would be a convenient moment.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I have one question I can deal with
3 now, and it's my fault, I should have explained to you
4 this morning. Have we seen the last of Owen? The
5 answer is no, you haven't. The position is that his
6 counsel who was here yesterday had an unbreakable
7 professional obligation today and for that reason and
8 also so we could get on with Mr Esposito, we have put
9 Owen back, but he will be back, possibly later this
10 week.
11 There is another question which I'll deal with at
12 the end of this witness. Quarter to.
13 (11.35 am)
14 (A short break)
15 (11.45 am)
16 (In the presence of the jury)
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
18 MR HOUGH: Mr Esposito, we know that Mr de Menezes leaves
19 Scotia Road at 9.34. We know that he boards a bus about
20 five minutes after that. When did you first become
21 aware that he had been picked up by the surveillance
22 team and was under surveillance?
23 A. I don't know exactly the time or exactly the place, but
24 it was before he got on the bus at Tulse Hill.
25 Q. How were you first aware that he was under surveillance?
69
1 What method of communication?
2 A. Again, I can't say, it was just what was going on in the
3 room at that time; whether it was from the surveillance
4 monitor or whether it was from the speaker, I don't
5 know, sir.
6 Q. When you first heard about him, so before he gets on the
7 bus, what information did you have about this man?
8 A. In respect of?
9 Q. You said that some information was coming into the
10 control room, you don't know from what source,
11 precisely, you got it; what did you hear about him by
12 way of description or identification or anything?
13 A. Again this is my reconstruction because I have obviously
14 read things, but at that time it was just a subject out
15 of an address. What the actual words were, I don't
16 know. I know since there have been various descriptions
17 at the time and I just formed an opinion at that time or
18 noticed that a person was out of the address.
19 Q. In your statement, and we can have it on screen if
20 necessary, you say this:
21 "At approximately 9.34, I became aware as a result
22 of information circulated in the control room that
23 a person had just left the front door of 21 Scotia Road
24 and was a possible identification for the subject
25 Hussain Osman."
70
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. First of all, did you hear that about him being
3 a possible identification for the subject?
4 A. Again, information, a subject out. How that was
5 actually communicated, I don't know. It may have just
6 been the surveillance monitor saying: we are following
7 a subject, subject out; and then I am listening to the
8 surveillance commentary.
9 Q. Obviously only tell me what you can remember but I do
10 have to press this a little. In that early period
11 before he gets on the bus, do you recall it being said
12 in the control room that he was a possible
13 identification for Osman?
14 A. At that early stage, I can't remember, sir.
15 Q. When you have heard that a man's come out, what did you
16 do?
17 A. I can't remember now if I actually got on the phone to
18 Trojan 84; it would have been something I normally did;
19 whether or not that would have been landline or mobile,
20 again, I don't know.
21 Q. In your statement you say that after this had happened,
22 you took up position in front of the surveillance pod
23 standing directly next to Commander Dick. Do you now
24 recall moving from your seat?
25 A. That original statement, it's almost like a precis of
71
1 what happened, because I know now that I didn't stand up
2 until right at the end. I was originally sitting down.
3 Q. In one of the seats we have looked at?
4 A. Yes, and that is sort of like a condensed statement
5 based on the fact that a subject came out and ...
6 Q. Was Commander Dick made aware of him coming out in that
7 early stage?
8 A. She was in the room, I assume so, sir, yes. Whether or
9 not it was there, whether or not it was actually as he
10 approached the bus or whether or not it was when he was
11 on the bus, again I don't know.
12 Q. I put this to you so that you have had it put by me
13 first. In your interview with the IPCC you were asked
14 on page 304:
15 "In your witness statement you say that about 9.34
16 you became aware of a person leaving Scotia Road. Was
17 Commander Dick made aware of that development?
18 "Answer: As far as I am aware, yes."
19 A. She was in the same room as I, listening to the
20 commentary. I can't be precise, sir, no.
21 Q. She has told us that she didn't become aware of him
22 probably until he was on the bus?
23 A. Very possible, sir.
24 Q. During that early period, was anything said about the
25 man's description in the control room?
72
1 A. Again from actual memory, I can't remember. Again, as
2 obviously reading the transcripts, reading what's
3 happened, I am now aware of it, especially as the --
4 been through the Health and Safety trial as well, so
5 I am aware of all the different descriptions. But I can
6 only say of the opinion that I formed at that time.
7 Q. Can we have page 351 of the documents on screen. If you
8 want to follow it, it's the log of Callum, which was
9 handed to you, page 3 in the top left. Right at the
10 bottom of that page, do we see 9.42:
11 "Male from Scotia Road, information unconfirmed as
12 at 9.42."
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: We haven't got it up yet, Mr Hough.
14 MR HOUGH: Page 351 of the documents.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's it.
16 MR HOUGH: "Male from Scotia Road, information unconfirmed
17 as at 9.42. IC1 male from address. May or may not be
18 subject now on bus."
19 A. Callum would have been sitting there, listening to
20 what's coming over the surveillance monitors, listening
21 to the speech in the room, and it's just his notes, his
22 recollection of what is happening, sir. I actually
23 didn't make a note of any of this, so I have to go on
24 what's written here as a refreshment of my memory.
25 Q. Simply putting it to you because he's writing it down
73
1 next to you.
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Then 9.44, over the page, he's recording this:
4 "Can we get bus route suspended Scotia Road [arrow]
5 from TJ80."
6 Again, do you recall saying anything like that or
7 hearing anything like that?
8 A. No, I have no recollection. I have read this, I have
9 read it a number of times since, and I don't know why
10 that's written there.
11 Q. So you don't think you asked whether the bus route could
12 be suspended on or near Scotia Road?
13 A. Because I am sure that we had had conversations previous
14 to this that they weren't going to be suspended, so it
15 wouldn't make sense to me that I would make this comment
16 now: can we get them suspended; when the decision had
17 already been taken by Commander Dick not to suspend
18 them.
19 Q. A call was made by Trojan 84 from his mobile to you at
20 9.44. Do you have any recollection of that call?
21 A. I actually made a number of calls to Trojan 84 during
22 this period, some by landline and on his mobile phone,
23 he called me.
24 Q. Over this period, there is at least one call during this
25 period where Mr de Menezes is first on the bus. Can you
74
1 remember what's passing between you and Trojan 84 over
2 this period?
3 A. No, I can't, sir.
4 Q. Do you know where Trojan 84 and the firearms teams were
5 at that stage?
6 A. It's my understanding that they were at the TA Centre,
7 sir.
8 Q. So you thought at that time they were at the TA Centre,
9 that's what was passing back to you?
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 Q. Now, 9.44:
12 "North African male seen from address on to bus from
13 Scotia Road address from surveillance team."
14 Do you recall a reference to a North African male at
15 around this time?
16 A. Yes, it's written there, and whether that's an actual
17 memory or a reconstruction, but it's -- it was said and
18 it's been said by a lot of people that it was said, so
19 yes, I have to accept that.
20 Q. Do you yourself have any independent recollection of
21 descriptions being given in the control room over this
22 period?
23 A. I know that -- that I, during a conversation that I had
24 with Trojan 84, at some time along this, I passed that
25 description on to Trojan 84 --
75
1 Q. North African male?
2 A. Well, North African male with the descriptions, because
3 it would normally be that I would contact them to say:
4 where are you, what's happening, are you aware of what's
5 going on.
6 Q. Were they receiving information about identification
7 directly from the surveillance teams at this time?
8 A. They would be listening to the surveillance channel in
9 exactly the same way as we were. They had direct access
10 to exactly the same communications, all the words that
11 are said by the surveillance officers in their vehicles.
12 Q. But you were passing some of the information on just to
13 be on the safe side?
14 A. Because we need to discuss tactics, options, what they
15 are doing.
16 Q. Then 9.45, another description noted by Callum, "IC2";
17 that's, I think, dark skinned European?
18 A. Mm.
19 Q. "denims, African-looking male now in Tulse Hill area,
20 surveillance team currently following".
21 A. Sir, yes.
22 Q. Then an entry I do need to ask you about at 9.46:
23 "Not ident male as above discounted, surveillance
24 team to withdraw to their original positions".
25 Did you hear anything like this said in the control
76
1 room?
2 A. Again, yes. Since that time, that I know some people or
3 some officers have said that I said something like,
4 "They don't think it's him", or something like that. My
5 only sources of intelligence at that time are what's
6 coming over the surveillance monitor, or if I'm on the
7 phone to Trojan 84, what's being said by Trojan 84.
8 So ...
9 Q. Now, just to follow that up, Trojan 84 can only know
10 about identification --
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Forgive me, Mr Hough, just reading back
12 your answer, what is the position? Do you remember
13 somebody saying, "It's not him"?
14 A. At that time, I formed the opinion, as a result of
15 what's going on, that they don't think it's him.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: So one way or another, words don't
17 matter --
18 A. Yes.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: -- you had got that into your mind that
20 they were now saying it's not him.
21 A. Yes, at that time.
22 MR HOUGH: What I was going to ask you about was the way you
23 got that impression and then about the impression
24 itself.
25 You are either getting that impression or any
77
1 impression about identification from the surveillance
2 teams directly, from their chatter?
3 A. That's the only sources of intelligence, that at that
4 time is the surveillance chatter, what's coming on over
5 there, either what I am listening to in the control room
6 or if I'm on the phone to Trojan 84, what he's listening
7 to and what I'm listening to on his phone and what he is
8 saying to me.
9 Q. His source is also the surveillance chatter?
10 A. It's the same source.
11 Q. So any impression that you form is either based directly
12 on what you hear from the surveillance teams or
13 indirectly what's said by them, heard by Trojan 84 and
14 passed on to you?
15 A. Yes, sir.
16 Q. Based upon that information, you tell us that you formed
17 the impression that this was not, this man being
18 followed, was not the suspect Osman?
19 A. At that time, yes.
20 Q. With what degree of certainty?
21 A. I have no degree of certainty, because I am not there.
22 All I can do is, if a decision is being made between
23 a command team or advisers, then everybody will chip in
24 to that initial decision-making; and if I hear
25 something, then it's incumbent on me to say to the DSO
78
1 or whoever is the decision-maker at that time what
2 I have heard, just to make sure that they've heard it;
3 and then a decision can be made as to what course of
4 action is taken.
5 Q. Was an instruction given in the control room for the
6 surveillance team to withdraw to their original
7 positions?
8 A. I don't know, sir.
9 Q. I only ask because it's written here.
10 A. No. No. No.
11 Q. You don't recall any such instruction being given?
12 A. No.
13 Q. Were you aware whether the surveillance team -- and by
14 this stage it's probably the grey team -- did withdraw
15 to their original positions?
16 A. I have got no idea, sir.
17 Q. In terms of time, we know that Mr de Menezes gets off
18 the bus at Brixton around 9.48 or 9.49. At that stage,
19 so when he's getting off the bus at Brixton, were you
20 aware of any further communications about what he was
21 doing and who he might be?
22 A. Again, listening to the surveillance at that time and
23 since that I know that he got off the bus, waited and
24 then got back on the bus, which to me indicated
25 a certain course of action --
79
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Don't be oblique. What do you mean?
2 A. Sorry. For me that was what we would consider to be
3 typical anti-surveillance operations, that if somebody
4 thought they were being followed, what they would do is
5 get off a mode of transport, just wait, look around, see
6 who also got off that mode of transport, and then get
7 back on another one.
8 MR HOUGH: And see who got on with them?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. In fact in your statement you say that you thought he
11 was conducting a form of anti-surveillance by getting on
12 and off the bus?
13 A. Yes, sir.
14 Q. In your interview you said that this behaviour added to
15 your considerations. How did it do that?
16 A. Well, if somebody behaves like that, especially at that
17 time, I think at that time I started to form the
18 opinion, I suppose from what was coming over the radio,
19 that this was our subject Nettle Tip.
20 Q. Was that impression, that it was now Nettle Tip, was
21 that based just on what you are hearing over the radio
22 or is it a combination of that and the fact that he's
23 doing something which you identify as anti-surveillance
24 tactics?
25 A. Again, my only sources of information are what's coming
80
1 over the radio. But if I'm told over the radio that
2 they think it's him or it's possible Nettle Tip, that,
3 put together with that behaviour, adds to the picture
4 that is being painted of the person that's being
5 followed by surveillance.
6 Q. At Brixton, what was being said about him over the radio
7 as far as you can remember?
8 A. I can't remember the details now, but I just remember
9 off the bus, because I thought it strange that he got
10 off the bus, and then I think the phrase "recip", which
11 means a reciprocal movement of going back on to the bus.
12 But the exact words, I can't be sure of. But it just
13 seemed to me strange. Why would a person get off the
14 bus and then wait and then get back on the bus.
15 Q. You can't recall at this time what was being said about
16 identification or facial description or anything like
17 that?
18 A. No. Throughout, I have got very little memory of the
19 actual words used. It's just the opinion that I formed
20 in my head as a result of what was coming over the
21 radio.
22 Q. 9.52, we see Callum recording:
23 "Possible Nettle Tip outside Brixton tube."
24 I am missing the last word.
25 "On bus. Station. Very jumpy. Probable ident. No
81
1 bags visible".
2 Do you think those kinds of things were being said
3 in the control room or can you just not remember?
4 A. As with me, his only source of intelligence would have
5 been what was coming over the radio. He wouldn't write
6 things -- I don't believe that he would have written
7 things down that weren't actually said, because they are
8 his source of intelligence.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Forgive my interrupting, can I just
10 see, this is the Cougar system that you were using?
11 A. The Cougar system, sir, yes.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I would like your help about two
13 things. This is when the follow was being carried out.
14 We have heard that there are either five or six cars in
15 the firearms team.
16 A. Sir, yes.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The Silver Commander -- no, start
18 again. There is the command car --
19 A. Control car.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Who would be in that?
21 A. In the control car would be Silver, the tactical adviser
22 Trojan 84, and one specialist firearms officer who was
23 the driver.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Not necessarily the team leader.
25 A. Not the team leader, no.
82
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: And of course the driver.
2 A. Yes.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Where would the team leader be?
4 A. I know that the team leader was in Trojan Bravo. I know
5 that now as a result of reading --
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That was a different car?
7 A. Yes.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: As to the radio communications, can
9 I get this clear: can each surveillance officer, subject
10 to blank spots and so forth, hear what every other
11 surveillance officer is saying.
12 A. Unless their radio has gone down. Every surveillance
13 officer has a radio, which they have got direct access
14 to what everybody else is saying and they can talk, it's
15 exactly the same way as we would be speaking in here,
16 anybody can speak at any time and everybody can hear
17 what's being said.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That includes --
19 A. The firearms officer.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The team leader, the tactical adviser
21 out on the road and the Silver Commander?
22 A. Yes, sir.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You in the control room can hear what
24 each surveillance officer is saying?
25 A. Yes, sir, unless there is a communications breakdown or
83
1 unless they are in a black spot.
2 Q. It is total communication?
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The firearms team, can the firearms
5 team leader hear what each surveillance officer is
6 saying?
7 A. There is a radio in every vehicle, which comes over
8 a loudspeaker --
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: All on the same net?
10 A. All on the same net. Everybody hears what everybody
11 else is saying.
12 MR HOUGH: At this point when you formed the impression that
13 it is probably your man, where are the firearms team as
14 far as you know?
15 A. Exactly where they were, I don't know, sir.
16 Q. Last we heard about them, which was earlier on when he
17 was coming out, they were at the TA Centre as far as you
18 knew?
19 A. Yes, probably still at the Territorial Army Centre but
20 I really don't know, sir. That instruction is, they may
21 have moved out at that time, I don't know, it depends
22 where in the time, because I don't know what times any
23 phone calls were made, what instructions, when they
24 moved off. That's their responsibility.
25 Q. Let me try to jog your memory in this way: you form
84
1 an impression that he is not the man around 9.46; you
2 form that he is the man around 9.52?
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. Between those two times, we will hear that Mr Dingemans
5 is sent out to perform a stop. Between those times, so
6 when you are forming those two impressions and when
7 Mr Dingemans is being sent out, where did you think the
8 firearms team were? Following along or waiting at the
9 TA Centre?
10 A. Probably waiting at the TA Centre, sir, because there
11 was no need for them to deploy at that time, if it was
12 not identical.
13 Q. So had you not given any instruction or indication to
14 them to move at that time?
15 A. I can't be precise about the timings, but along
16 a continuum, roughly no, sir.
17 Q. So now it's 9.52, you have formed the impression that
18 it's probably your man. Again, what kind of certainty
19 are you attaching to that identification?
20 A. I can't say now. At that time it was building for me.
21 Q. Did you pass on to others in the control room the view
22 that it was probably your man or that your certainty was
23 building?
24 A. No, because everybody is listening to exactly the same
25 as I am, and everybody forms their own opinion based on
85
1 what they hear.
2 Q. So you are not a separate source of information about
3 identification to the others in the control room?
4 A. Absolutely not, sir.
5 Q. Did any of the surveillance officers in your hearing say
6 that this was probably Nettle Tip?
7 A. It's my recollection that's exactly what was said.
8 Q. By a surveillance officer or by Pat?
9 A. Again I can't be sure who said, but it was probable.
10 Q. We have heard from others that Mr Boutcher and/or
11 Commander Dick asked the surveillance teams through
12 their monitor to give either a percentage or a 1 out of
13 10 score about identification and certainty. First of
14 all, do you recall anything like that happening?
15 A. I remember that conversation, but I wasn't party to that
16 because I am concentrating on other things at that time.
17 Q. Did that conversation take place before or after you
18 formed the view that it was probably Nettle Tip?
19 A. Again, I can't say.
20 Q. Can you recall the response that Pat gave on behalf of
21 the surveillance teams?
22 A. No.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: One of the factors, as I understand it,
24 that led to your belief that it was probable was what
25 you have described as the possible anti-surveillance
86
1 tactic about getting off the bus and on again.
2 A. That's part of it, sir, but --
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I know. Did you know at the time that
4 Brixton station was closed?
5 A. No, I didn't.
6 MR HOUGH: We see further down a note at 9.56 that the
7 location of the bus is at Stockwell Road, and then if we
8 can turn the page, please, do we see there a note at
9 10.02:
10 "Stockwell Road appears he may be getting off the
11 bus, located on top deck".
12 A. That's correct, sir.
13 Q. Do you recall information coming in from the scene that
14 the surveillance officers were seeing the subject
15 getting up on the top deck, thought possibly getting off
16 the bus?
17 A. Yes, sir.
18 Q. When that happened, what was the reaction in the control
19 room?
20 A. Cressida -- the DSO was asking me around what tactics
21 were available, what we could do, what were the issues.
22 Q. At this time, in fact at 9.59, Trojan 84 makes a call to
23 you which lasts for nine minutes?
24 A. That's correct.
25 Q. Do you recall that call, that long call?
87
1 A. It had been part of a pre-agreement that if we were
2 following a subject to keep an open line, so that any
3 decisions made by the DSO could be directly relayed to
4 the teams. There was a landline phone call a little
5 before that where I spoke to Trojan 84, because that's
6 what we were going to do, keep an open phone line.
7 Originally made that phone call, I spoke to him, and he
8 started to give me some information about where they
9 were and what they were doing. But at that time, the
10 surveillance was still giving information, so Trojan 84
11 wanted to speak to the surveillance controller. So he
12 cut me off and said, "I'll phone you back when I have
13 established control and contact with the surveillance
14 team leader". So that's what that long phone call was,
15 that he then phoned me back and said, "I am now with you
16 again".
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: So it's not really a nine-minute phone
18 call. It's just that the line was open?
19 A. That was a nine-minute phone call from that time because
20 we kept the phone call open for --
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's what I mean. You weren't
22 talking for the whole --
23 A. Absolutely not, no.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You just kept the line open?
25 A. We were just feeding information through to each other.
88
1 MR HOUGH: Is this right: you have a landline, open line
2 call to him --
3 A. Initially, yes.
4 Q. Then that breaks off?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. He calls back at 9.59 and you retain the open line after
7 that?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. At this time, when he's calling you back, what were his
10 teams doing then?
11 A. At that time, they were following, after Stockwell --
12 sorry, after Brixton tube, they were following up,
13 catching up with the bus.
14 Q. Was that because of an instruction you gave or something
15 they decided, having heard what the surveillance teams
16 were saying?
17 A. I don't know, sir, but it's normal that if you are
18 following a subject then you will keep a reasonable
19 distance behind until an order is given to do
20 an interception or whatever, to ensure that the
21 operation remains covert.
22 Q. We have heard you saying that 9.44 or thereabouts, they
23 are at the TA Centre; 9.52, before you form your
24 impression that it's probably your man, they are
25 probably still at the TA Centre but you can't be
89
1 certain?
2 A. I have no record of time, sir. I actually don't know,
3 putting time and distance, I actually couldn't say --
4 this is a reconstruction, and where exactly they were
5 and what times these were made; the only absolute really
6 is the mobile phone record, so ...
7 Q. When you formed your impression that it was probably
8 him, Brixton, after that, do you recall giving any
9 instruction to the firearms team through Trojan 84?
10 A. Only as a result of the order given by the DSO --
11 Q. Do you recall giving them, I can put it this way: you
12 don't recall then giving them an instruction to start
13 following up the road towards Stockwell tube?
14 A. It was very likely that, as part of this conversation,
15 because it would be normal things that we do: are you
16 hearing this; we think it's probably our man; you need
17 to get there; get the team in place.
18 Q. You don't recall the instruction being given but you
19 think it might well have been given?
20 A. Yes. It would be normal practice to do that.
21 Q. So is this fair: they probably started the follow, as
22 far as you can recall, when you started to form the
23 impression that it was probably your man?
24 A. I can't say exactly when they started to follow, because
25 they are listening to exactly the same things as me.
90
1 They will also take decisions that if they think the
2 intelligence is developing, then it might not
3 necessarily be waiting for an order from me, they would
4 take it on their own initiative to do that.
5 Q. Now, man is getting off the bus; what decision, if any,
6 does Commander Dick make as a result of that?
7 A. Again the actual decisions, and the actual words used
8 I can't now be 100 per cent sure, but she wanted, stop
9 the man, to do an armed interception.
10 Q. Did she say anything about not letting the man
11 underground?
12 A. I think that was a second order that she gave.
13 Q. Do you recall her using the phrase "at all costs" in
14 relation to either stopping him or not letting him get
15 underground?
16 A. That's not my recollection, no.
17 Q. Was there any consideration at this point about possibly
18 letting the man get on to the tube, letting him go off
19 under surveillance without conducting an armed
20 interception?
21 A. Absolutely none, sir.
22 Q. Wasn't even discussed?
23 A. I was not party to any of those discussion, if they
24 were, but it would be inconceivable to me that that's
25 what would have been discussed, based on the
91
1 intelligence and the background of this and previous
2 operations.
3 Q. We heard yesterday about a note that an assistant to
4 Mr Whiddett of SO12 made. I am sure you were aware of
5 this, that there was a management discussion at this
6 point in proceedings, and Commander Dick said something
7 to the effect that the man could run on to the tube
8 because he wasn't carrying anything, or that she raised
9 it as a topic for discussion or that somebody in the
10 management group did; and that then the note suggests
11 that she was persuaded otherwise by another senior
12 officer, but Mr Whiddett's assistant says that was
13 probably wrong.
14 Do you remember anything like any of those
15 discussions?
16 A. I have absolutely no recollection of that at all, sir.
17 Q. Now, 10.02, a further note in Callum's log:
18 "Stockwell Road junction with Clapham Road, subject
19 off bus".
20 Do you recall in the control room it now coming
21 through that the man had actually got off the bus?
22 A. Yes, I do.
23 Q. Was it also reported in the control room that he was
24 walking towards the tube?
25 A. Yes, it was, sir.
92
1 Q. We have heard from a man I was telling you about
2 earlier, Nick, that there was an almost palpable intake
3 of breath in the control room at this point, a real
4 concern. Do you recall that kind of reaction?
5 A. No. My job here at this moment is to wait for the
6 designated senior officer to give an order what needed
7 to be done, what she wants to be done.
8 Q. She's given that order, and to stop the man, armed
9 intervention, you have an open line to Trojan 84?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. What do you say to him?
12 A. I relay that decision down to Trojan 84 down the phone.
13 Q. Did he tell you at that point where the six cars
14 containing the specialist firearms officers were?
15 A. No. Because he doesn't need to.
16 Q. You give him the instruction, but he doesn't need to
17 tell you where they are?
18 A. No. If I can expand on that, the role of Trojan 84 is
19 to manage the firearms teams on the ground. What I need
20 to know is are they in a position, are they ready to go.
21 How those vehicles are configured is a responsibility of
22 Trojan 84 and the team leader on the ground.
23 Q. When you -- sorry?
24 A. It wouldn't be possible for me -- for him to keep
25 relaying to me where all the position of the six
93
1 vehicles are.
2 Q. I appreciate that, but when you have actually relayed
3 the instruction, does he then tell you where they are?
4 A. He says they are in Stockwell -- he says that they are
5 there at Stockwell.
6 Q. This is quite important, so we will take it in stages.
7 A. I understand there was a delay because Trojan 84, when
8 I was speaking to him on the phone and the order comes
9 in from the DSO, the person to be stopped going down the
10 tube, Trojan 84 informs me, "We are in position". What
11 then happened was that -- sorry, my understanding of
12 what happened was that the surveillance people said,
13 "The person is now getting off the bus". It's at that
14 point, and this again is my understanding, that
15 Trojan 84 realises that there is another bus across the
16 other side of the junction, and the subject is actually
17 getting off of that bus, which puts them about 50 or
18 60 yards behind that bus.
19 Q. Okay, let us take that in stages. You relay the
20 instruction from Commander Dick?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. What you hear -- forget for the moment what you have
23 heard later -- from him is him saying that they are at
24 Stockwell?
25 A. As that is relayed to me, and I relay it to him, he just
94
1 says something like, "We are not in a position to do
2 it". At that moment it's a very fast-moving situation,
3 so I just turn to the DSO and I say, "They are not in
4 a position to do it".
5 Q. But he didn't say how far away they were, or when they
6 might be in a position to do it?
7 A. No, I just naturally assumed that they are then making
8 their way immediately towards that location, because
9 that's what they would do, that's what their training
10 says that they do; they then go forward to the
11 interception. However, I am still waiting for the order
12 from the DSO as to what they want CO19 to do.
13 Q. Sorry, we will have to go back to the sequence --
14 A. I don't think I am explaining myself very well here.
15 Q. It's fine. It's understood. We just need to get it
16 from you clearly.
17 There is an initial communication from the
18 surveillance officers that a man is getting up and may
19 be getting off the bus?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. At that stage, does the designated senior officer give
22 any kind of order?
23 A. I can't remember exactly when the order was given,
24 exactly when he was on the bus, when he was off the bus,
25 I can't exactly remember the time, because I don't know
95
1 where he is and I am not listening to that.
2 Q. Fine. A time comes when she gives an order?
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. You relay that order to Trojan 84?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Is it at that point that he tells you that they are not
7 in position?
8 A. I believe so, yes.
9 Q. So she has given the order by the time he tells you they
10 are not in position?
11 A. It's my understanding that -- at that time it's still
12 a mobile follow. The person gets off the bus but the
13 armed response vehicles still have to be a reasonable
14 distance behind that vehicle to maintain the integrity
15 of the operation. It's because we don't know if the bus
16 is going on, we don't know if it's going to Central
17 London, we don't know what the bus is going to do and we
18 don't know what the subject is going to do at that
19 stage. So it's right and proper that the firearms team
20 maintain a reasonable distance from that vehicle in
21 order to maintain the integrity of that operation.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Sorry, didn't you know where a number 2
23 bus was going?
24 A. Personally I didn't, sir.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: All right.
96
1 A. The route generally, but there is no indication, the
2 route travels all the way, as I understand now, right to
3 Central London.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You didn't know that at the time?
5 A. No. No, I didn't, sir.
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I see.
7 MR HOUGH: Is this right, there was a concern that having
8 six vehicles, either roughly or actually in convoy,
9 filled with three or four or between two and four men
10 looking up for it and ready and possibly with equipment
11 at the ready, might alert somebody?
12 A. That's why they have to stand a reasonable distance
13 behind. Because if they get too close to the bus and
14 a person doesn't get off, looks out the back window,
15 sees the vehicle, that's why the distance has to be
16 maintained.
17 Q. Going back to the sequence of events, that is why they
18 might have to be a distance back. Going back to the
19 sequence of events, the order is given. After the order
20 is given, you pass it on?
21 A. Yes, sir.
22 Q. After you pass it on, you are told, "We are not in
23 position to perform the stop"?
24 A. Sir.
25 Q. Okay. But at that point, you didn't know precisely how
97
1 far back they were. You may be able to make deductions
2 from your general practice but you didn't know?
3 A. Mm.
4 Q. We have heard that the surveillance monitor passed on
5 an offer from the grey team leader for the surveillance
6 officers to stop the man; is that something you heard?
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 Q. What decision was made following that offer?
9 A. I remember having a discussion with the DSO about what
10 was the most appropriate resource. Now, bearing in mind
11 this is a very quick conversation, this is a very
12 headline conversation, because it's happening very, very
13 quickly. At that time, I know that CO19 are moving
14 forward. The decision that the DSO has to make at that
15 time is what resource does she want to conduct this
16 stop, and I advise her on the capabilities of the
17 resources at that particular point.
18 Q. What did you advise her to do?
19 A. I advised her against SO12 to do that interception.
20 Q. So you advised her that she should wait for the CO19
21 officers, even though they weren't in position?
22 A. They are following the bus, they are a reasonable
23 distance behind the bus. The thought processes going on
24 in my mind at that time, what are we actually asking
25 these officers to do. We are asking them to conduct
98
1 an armed interception, in probably the most difficult
2 circumstances imaginable. A stop to an SO12 officer is
3 a containment and challenge. A stop to an SO19 officer
4 is an intervention, and there is a world of difference
5 between what we are asking them to do.
6 We are asking SO12 officers to contain and challenge
7 a person who we believed at that time to be a suicide
8 terrorist in an extreme threat scenario. So I have to
9 advise the DSO what's the best resource at that time.
10 Q. In giving that advice, you are balancing on the one hand
11 the fact that the SO12 team are saying that they are
12 there and they are offering to do it, against the fact
13 that they are not as highly trained and as you say, this
14 is an entirely different kind of challenge from what
15 they are used to?
16 A. Yes, it's just not a simple choice of them or them,
17 because there is far more to it than that. This is not
18 something that they do on a day-to-day basis. SO19
19 train for this. They are highly skilled. They are
20 highly able officers. SO12 officers are reactively
21 firearms trained, so therefore the tactic that they will
22 use at that particular time will be totally different to
23 that used by CO19.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: When you gave that advice, by that
25 time, what was your view as to the probability of this
99
1 being a suicide bomber?
2 A. I believed it was Nettle Tip, without a shadow of
3 a doubt, at that time. That's why I made that decision.
4 That's why I gave that advice to the DSO.
5 MR HOUGH: What did the DSO decide to do?
6 A. Almost immediately that we were having this
7 conversation, I was informed on the -- because I still
8 had the open phone to my ear, that CO19 were there, and
9 almost simultaneously I said it, CO19 deployed on the
10 directions of the DSO.
11 Q. We have heard from some of the other officers in the
12 room that Commander Dick actually gave the order for
13 SO12 officers to perform the stop. Do you recall her
14 doing so?
15 A. Because I had the open phone to Trojan 84 and I was
16 looking at the DSO out of one eye, listening to
17 Trojan 84 on the phone, I actually didn't hear that.
18 Q. So you say that almost simultaneously you receive word
19 from Trojan 84. What did he say?
20 A. He said -- the exact words again -- "We are here, we are
21 there".
22 Q. No more detail than that?
23 A. It was very, very quick, it was almost instantaneous, it
24 didn't need to be any more than that.
25 Q. What response did you make following that?
100
1 A. I just informed the DSO, "They are there"; she said,
2 "CO19 do", and then I informed Trojan 84.
3 Q. In your statement, again we can have it on screen if it
4 helps you, the third page of your statement, the one you
5 gave in 2005, third page, you say about halfway down the
6 page:
7 "At that moment, as I received information that the
8 subject was entering the Underground station, Trojan 84
9 reported to me that they were able to go to state red
10 and were able to conduct the intercept and arrest.
11 I requested that the control relay to all surveillance
12 officers not to intercept. I quickly discussed options
13 with Commander Dick to the effect of what now? The
14 decision was that as the subject was in the station, not
15 to allow to leave, to arrest before he gets on a train
16 and leaves the station."
17 A. That section there is my precis of what probably
18 took space -- in a few seconds. So it's trying to
19 describe the speed of the decision-making; it's trying
20 to describe what was happening in a chronological order
21 that made sense in the statement.
22 Q. What that statement does suggest is that when this
23 conversation is taking place, when you have just heard
24 from Trojan 84 that his team are there, and when you are
25 discussing options with Commander Dick, at that point
101
1 the statement suggests that the subject was very near or
2 into the Underground station. Does that accord with
3 your recollection?
4 A. I can't be exactly sure of where they were at that time.
5 I didn't know if it was outside the tube station,
6 entering the tube station, in the tube station. It was
7 just in that area.
8 Q. What the statement also says is that the decision was
9 that CO19 should stop the subject before he got on the
10 train, which suggests that it might be in the station.
11 Again, does that --
12 A. It could possibly be, sir, yes.
13 Q. So when this discussion was taking place, was it
14 thought, was it something in your mind that this might
15 have to be a stop within the tube station?
16 A. When the DSO asks for a decision to intercept, the team
17 will then go forward from that point and conduct the
18 interception. If the order is given with them
19 sufficient time to conduct it outside, then that's where
20 they will conduct it. If the time gap then continues
21 and they have to do it on the escalator, then they will
22 do it on the escalator. If it then continues and goes
23 further down, they will do it where they are able, based
24 on the time they are given to deploy.
25 Q. But at this time that the decision was being made, and
102
1 I appreciate it was very quick, it was a consideration
2 that you had in your mind that this stop might take
3 place at any point either outside or inside the tube
4 station?
5 A. It's -- when you order an interception, you can't pick
6 the location that you want to do that interception, and
7 it would be wrong to pick that location, because what is
8 an ideal location one second can be an absolute terrible
9 location for an interception the next, because it
10 changes that quickly. One second a road can be empty,
11 the next it can be full of people, especially at a tube
12 station. So you can't pick the location. So I am
13 comfortable and I am satisfied that if an order is given
14 for CO19 to do the interception, then the team leader,
15 given the time frame that they are allowed to do it in,
16 will deploy in the circumstances most appropriate.
17 Q. It may be suggested, so I'll put this suggestion to you,
18 that when you were giving advice to reject SO12's offer
19 to do the stop, to use CO19 instead and giving advice to
20 Commander Dick on the options when Trojan 84 has said
21 his team are there, that you should have been checking
22 at that point precisely where they were because their
23 precise position might affect the judgment of whether to
24 use them rather than SO12. What would be your response
25 to that suggestion?
103
1 A. It wouldn't have affected my judgment as to which
2 resource to use, and based on the information that I had
3 and the resources that I had there at the time, it
4 wouldn't have changed the decision where they actually
5 did it. CO19 were the most appropriate resource to do
6 it at that time. They were the most highly trained,
7 they were the most highly able, and when you say about
8 tactical options that I discussed with Cressida Dick at
9 that time, it was about: they can do the interception;
10 that's the option, an interception. There isn't a wide
11 range of options that we discussed. It wasn't a cold,
12 calm, collected conversation. It was as quick as that.
13 "CO19 can do an interception". That's what I talk about
14 tactics. That's just a way of describing it in the cold
15 light of day in the statement.
16 Q. If CO19 had been five minutes away, stuck behind
17 a jack-knifed trailer, so no chance of getting there,
18 would your advice about using SO12 have been different?
19 A. Possibly. Yes, probably, because -- but the advice in
20 relation to that, what I would have to say to the DSO
21 is: if you use this resource, this is what it's going to
22 look like, this is what their intervention or
23 interception will look like, and it will be
24 a containment and challenge; and based on the
25 information and based on the intelligence that you have
104
1 at that time, then the DSO will make that decision. But
2 the decision is that to be made by the DSO.
3 Q. But it's right, then, that your advice is to a certain
4 extent affected by your knowledge of where the firearms
5 teams are and whether they will be in a position to make
6 the intervention in practice?
7 A. In a fast-moving situation like this, yes, there is two
8 options. You can either hand control over to the team
9 leader and say, "Do the interception when you think it's
10 right to do it", or you can then say, "No, I want to try
11 to manage those resources because I know intelligence,
12 I know things that are going on, and I want to try to
13 steer it in a particular direction".
14 Q. Which of those options did you take here?
15 A. It's not up for me to take that decision --
16 Q. The control room, I mean?
17 A. The interception was managed by and controlled by the
18 DSO.
19 Q. Now, we have heard evidence again from this chap Nick
20 that the surveillance monitor said that the suspect was
21 going down the escalators before the order was given to
22 CO19 to perform the stop. Do you recall that?
23 A. As I said, I have absolutely no idea where the subject
24 was in relation to time or distance at that time.
25 Q. When the order was given?
105
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. And when the advice was given, presumably?
3 A. (Witness nods)
4 Q. Now, the order has been given, and I think very shortly
5 after that communications were lost?
6 A. Yes, that's correct, sir.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You knew that would happen, of course.
8 A. Absolutely. We knew that we had no communications in
9 the Underground at that time.
10 MR HOUGH: You obviously didn't know that you would
11 necessarily lose communications, because if they managed
12 the interception above ground, then you wouldn't lose
13 communications --
14 A. Sorry --
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: -- if they went down the escalator?
16 A. It was generally known that the Cougar radio did not
17 work underground at that time.
18 MR HOUGH: Did the time come some minutes after that that
19 you were notified that somebody had been shot?
20 A. I kept the open phone line with Trojan 84 and it was
21 Trojan 84 that informed me on the radio that subject had
22 been shot.
23 Q. Can we finally deal with a couple of logs? Can we go
24 back to the operational policy log, page 6 this time.
25 Do you see the passage beginning "Review of Tactics",
106
1 right at the bottom of the page?
2 A. Sir, yes.
3 Q. Is that again your handwriting?
4 A. It is, yes, sir.
5 Q. I am going to read through it but before I do, is this
6 right, this is something you wrote up at 10.40, 20 to
7 11, on that morning, so about 35 minutes after the
8 shooting?
9 A. Yes. It was -- because of the fast-moving nature of it,
10 and because of the fact that I had been giving advice to
11 Cressida Dick, I didn't have a chance to even record
12 what my thought processes were. So I just wanted to
13 make a note of it at that time where everything was
14 immediately fresh in my mind. It's quite a short note
15 but it was just what I was thinking at that time.
16 Q. Let us just run through it quickly:
17 "Subject seen leaving the address followed on to
18 a number 2 bus [the registration number given].
19 Nettle Tip seen top deck outside Brixton tube, seen to
20 be jumpy, made phone call and text messages. Subject
21 still under control towards Oval tube..."
22 Which was, I think, further up the bus route?
23 A. Yes, sir.
24 Q. "Informed on the stairs."
25 That's the information coming through that he is
107
1 getting up and going down the stairs.
2 "Decision by the DSO not to let the subject on the
3 tube for risk of explosive devices. Subject enters the
4 tube followed by CO19 and surveillance. CO19 given
5 authority to intercept and arrest the subject who..."
6 A. I think it's "follow", sir.
7 Q. "surveillance". Perhaps you can help us with the next
8 word?
9 A. "... down the tube, communications lost."
10 Q. Then "rationale" underlined. "previous underground
11 devices"?
12 A. "positive".
13 Q. "Positive identification of subject by surveillance as
14 Nettle Tip."
15 So you are there recording that first of all the
16 decisions were informed by the fact that devices had
17 been used underground in the past?
18 A. That's right, sir, yes.
19 Q. Secondly, the decision was informed by the fact that the
20 person had been positively identified as Nettle Tip?
21 A. They were my immediate memories immediately afterwards
22 headlined in this note.
23 Q. Then also part of the rationale:
24 "Subject made phone calls and text messages seen to
25 be made. Subject seemed to be nervous. No bags seen
108
1 but still posed a threat, body devices..."
2 Is that "et cetera"?
3 A. Et cetera. That is because the generic intelligence
4 that we had at that time was around body-borne devices,
5 small concealable devices, although it had then
6 developed on to rucksacks. But all the information we
7 had had up to that time was around body-borne devices.
8 Q. "The risk to the public uppermost in my mind. This was
9 an identified suicide terrorist who posed an immediate
10 and imminent threat to the public."
11 Then:
12 "The contingency for non-compliance has been
13 discussed and explained that if the officers perceive
14 a threat from the subject which could be
15 life-threatening to police and public."
16 That's a sentence that says:
17 "... if the officers perceive a threat from the
18 subject which could be life-threatening to police and
19 public".
20 The end of that sentence has been missed out. Can
21 you supply it for us?
22 A. It's around the training, it's around what normally
23 happens in ordinary firearms operations and in as well
24 as this, that they will take whatever action that they
25 feel is appropriate at that time to minimise that risk
109
1 to themselves and the public.
2 Q. We have heard, and I can show up on screen, probably
3 it's best if I do, page 211 of the documents files.
4 (Pause)
5 We have heard from Mr Boutcher, both on his
6 recollection and from his log, that you indicated after
7 the event that this had not been a Kratos situation?
8 A. That's correct, sir.
9 Q. Do you recall saying that to him?
10 A. Yes. Well, because it wasn't.
11 Q. He also recorded and remembers you saying that the
12 specialist firearms officers will have acted in response
13 to non-compliance?
14 A. They would have reacted to what they saw in front of
15 them at that time.
16 Q. Now, there is a reference, as we have seen in the
17 operational policy log in the entry we have just been
18 looking at, to "non-compliance".
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: There is your document, Mr Hough.
20 MR HOUGH: "Contingency for non-compliance has been
21 discussed and explained."
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. When the order was given, you were clear in your mind
24 that this was not an order to carry out a critical shot?
25 A. Absolutely, sir.
110
1 Q. It was an order to perform an armed interception which
2 might result in shots being fired?
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. From your point of view, as one of the architects or
5 certainly one of the book writers on Kratos, there had
6 not been an order for a critical shot, just
7 an interception?
8 A. Yes, sir.
9 Q. In those circumstances, and against that background,
10 would you have expected the specialist firearms officers
11 to administer a critical shot if the subject did nothing
12 to suggest non-compliance?
13 A. The firearms officers can only act on what happens in
14 front of them at any particular time. I am not there,
15 and I can't say what happened or what didn't happen.
16 I can only talk from my point of view. Firearms
17 officers throughout their training are taught to react
18 to the threat that is posed in front of them at any
19 particular time. So their response would have been as
20 a result of what happened in front of them at that time.
21 Q. I don't know if we can get Mr Boutcher's log up,
22 page 211, yet. It's tab 44 of the jury bundle, if it
23 helps. There is quite a lot of material under there.
24 (Pause)
25 Page 211, if you flick on, is page 10. This written
111
1 by Mr Boutcher:
2 "I spoke to Chief Inspector Esposito, SO19 tactical
3 adviser, to clarify the position regarding the
4 intervention of the subject. Chief Inspector Esposito
5 stated that the SO19 officers were conducting
6 an orthodox armed intervention and the officers'
7 instructions were clear. The officers will have
8 challenged the subject and his responses will have
9 resulted in the officers' actions."
10 Is that what you said to Mr Boutcher shortly after
11 this event?
12 A. I can't remember saying it, but that looks an awful lot
13 like something I would have said, because that directly
14 reflects the training that the officers have.
15 Q. So would you have expected the officers to challenge the
16 subject ordinarily?
17 A. They can only -- they will issue a challenge dependent
18 on what is in front of them at that time. I can't say
19 whether I would have expected it or wouldn't have
20 expected it. In some circumstances a challenge will be
21 appropriate. In other circumstances a challenge will be
22 wholly inappropriate. So it's actually not as clear as
23 that. The decision for a challenge rests with the
24 officers at the point of interception.
25 Q. I'm only asking you because it appears in the log and it
112
1 is suggested by the log of Mr Boutcher that you said
2 that the officers, you would have expected to have
3 challenged the subject.
4 A. I can't speak for the officers, and all I can say is
5 that it is the training, states that a challenge will
6 only be given if it's appropriate at that point of
7 interception. I can't say more than that, sir.
8 MR HOUGH: Thank you very much, those are my questions.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: A couple of things, please.
10 Questions from THE CORONER
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: As I understand you, when you gave your
12 advice against SO12 doing the stop, you were
13 perfectly -- you would be perfectly willing, as
14 I understand it, to have seen CO19 carry out
15 an interception or an intervention at any point prior to
16 the subject getting on the train? If they thought it
17 was appropriate?
18 A. Yes, sir. That's what they are trained to do. Their
19 training allows them to conduct interceptions in the
20 street, in buildings, in vehicles, in trains, in any
21 mode of transport. That's what the training allows. So
22 if as a result of the order for an interception to be
23 given, the circumstances then took them into any one of
24 those environments, then they are capable of conducting
25 an interception at that point, and I am satisfied with
113
1 that level of training.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: So you would not have regarded it as
3 an insuperable difficulty if, by the time they came to
4 be in a position to make a stop, they were down the
5 escalators?
6 A. The threat never changes. The threat they were dealing
7 with at that time was a suicide terrorist. What changes
8 is the circumstances and the location of that
9 interception.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's what I am trying to get at, you
11 see. Or on the --
12 A. It adds difficulties, sir, it adds difficulties, but the
13 training of the officers is such that it allows them to
14 overcome those difficulties. But because of the nature
15 of the operation, once an order is given, you don't know
16 where that is going to take you, you don't know what's
17 going to happen, so it's essential that the officers
18 conducting that interception are flexible in the way
19 that they do it.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Is it an additional hazardous factor
21 that, if they have gone down the escalators, you will
22 have lost contact with them?
23 A. Yes, sir. It's a result of the equipment that we had at
24 that time.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: In those circumstances, of course, you
114
1 have to leave it to the individual officers to decide
2 what is --
3 A. Once the order has been given, we always have to leave
4 it to the individual officers to decide.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Okay.
6 The second thing I am asked to ask you, and this is
7 a convenient moment to do it: you and Andrew prepared
8 the tactical options document the previous day?
9 A. Sir, yes.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: And you have told us that you gave it
11 to Mr McDowall and, I think, to Superintendent Boutcher?
12 A. Yes, sir.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Was it discussed at the 7.15 meeting?
14 A. I can't remember whether this document was discussed in
15 the 7.15 meeting, but I know I discussed it at length
16 with the DSO.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Was it ever intended to be discussed at
18 the briefing of SO19 in Nightingale Lane?
19 A. What would have been -- no, this document would've been
20 discussed there. What the tactical adviser --
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Would or would not?
22 A. Would not, sir. What the tactical adviser on the ground
23 would be doing with the Silver on the ground would be
24 talking about what is their option and what is their
25 intention at that time. Their intention was to provide
115
1 mobile armed support to surveillance at Scotia Road as
2 well as at Portnall Road. So as a result of that,
3 various options could have arisen.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: But the basic document, the tactical
5 options document, that was a matter for discussion
6 between you and the senior officers?
7 A. But it's also there for the tac advisers on the ground
8 and the Silvers on the ground to make initial reference
9 to because, had the operation developed into something
10 else, had it developed into a static operation around
11 premises, then all the options for that are contained in
12 this document.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
14 I have a request, which I suspect you will say you
15 can't answer because I think it's probably a request for
16 an explosives officer.
17 The request is this: we have heard several times
18 about body borne devices; at what point will the jury be
19 shown a sample?
20 I think we might be able to produce photographs.
21 MR HOUGH: Probably a question for me rather than for the
22 witness. An explosives officer will be called, and
23 photographs and descriptions of devices will be
24 provided.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you. I think that's the best
116
1 answer you are going to get, I don't think you are going
2 to see samples. Thank you.
3 Now, five minutes, Mr Mansfield, or would you rather
4 start at five to 2?
5 MR MANSFIELD: May I do something mildly unusual, which is
6 ask the question so he has plenty of time to think about
7 it over lunch?
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
9 Questions from MR MANSFIELD
10 MR MANSFIELD: Good morning. I am Michael Mansfield,
11 I represent the family of Jean Charles de Menezes.
12 You may be expecting this question because I ask it
13 of the senior officers and you are perhaps the most
14 senior tactical adviser that we have seen.
15 The question is this, but may I frame it in this
16 context: you have presumably reflected over what
17 happened that day over quite a few years now since it
18 happened; is that right?
19 A. Absolutely, sir, yes.
20 Q. And you have read a lot of material relating to this
21 whole exercise?
22 A. Yes, sir.
23 Q. Have you read the evidence that was given at the Health
24 and Safety trial?
25 A. I have read some of it, sir, yes.
117
1 Q. And you are aware of the verdict in that trial?
2 A. Yes, sir.
3 Q. And you are aware of some of the materials that have
4 been put before this jury, if you have followed these
5 proceedings?
6 A. Only some, sir, yes.
7 Q. Which bits, may I ask?
8 A. I read the transcript of the DSO, and I read the
9 transcript of Andrew.
10 MR MANSFIELD: In that context, the question is this: do you
11 consider that anything went wrong that day? All right,
12 that's the question.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: And you don't want an answer at the
14 moment?
15 MR MANSFIELD: No, because he has plenty of time to think,
16 and it's over lunch. Thank you.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The only thing I would say to you,
18 Mr Esposito, and I'm sure you will appreciate this, you
19 have lunch to think it over but the answer of course
20 must be yours.
21 A. It's a very short answer, sir.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You can give it and Mr Mansfield can
23 think it over, over lunch.
24 A. The short answer, sir, is that for me it actually gets
25 taken back to 7 July when the bombings happened, then
118
1 onto 21 July, to the failed bombings, and all the events
2 that happened on that day for me as a tactical adviser
3 boil down to one simple thing, and that is the
4 misidentification. It's as simple as that for me, sir,
5 as the tactical adviser. It's a tragedy, sir, but for
6 me it's as simple as that.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you. Will that do, Mr Mansfield?
8 MR MANSFIELD: Certainly just before lunch, yes.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well, 2 o'clock.
10 (1.00 pm)
11 (The short adjournment)
12 (2.00 pm)
13 (In the presence of the jury)
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Simply so you know what awaits you,
15 I would like to sit on tonight, if nobody has any
16 difficulties, until about 5.00 to get as much of this
17 witness done as we can, and I'm going to trespass upon
18 your goodwill tomorrow morning: 9.30.
19 Yes, Mr Mansfield.
20 MR MANSFIELD: Good afternoon. I just want to, if I may,
21 going back to the question before lunch, is there
22 anything else you want to add to it that you have
23 thought about over lunch or is that it?
24 A. That's it, sir, yes.
25 Q. So it would be fair to say that as far as you are
119
1 concerned, there was no firearms decision that was
2 erroneous in any shape or form, that you are responsible
3 for?
4 A. Not in my view, no, sir.
5 Q. No, not in your view. Obviously I'm only going to ask
6 you about those matters that relate to your
7 responsibility as opposed to obviously others, and you
8 follow that, I am sure.
9 So the issue as far as you are concerned, then,
10 looking back on it all, was identification. Now, I am
11 going to take it in stages -- or rather
12 misidentification as it turned out.
13 You told the jury that you thought this individual
14 had been positively identified as Nettle Tip and you
15 used this phrase, "without a shadow of a doubt", or
16 "beyond a shadow of a doubt", just before lunch, do you
17 remember?
18 A. I was in the control room throughout that period, and my
19 sources of intelligence were what was coming through
20 from the surveillance. From the time that the subject,
21 who was identified to me as Nettle Tip, went throughout
22 that journey, getting on and off the bus at Brixton,
23 right through the second part of the journey, up until
24 he got off the bus at Stockwell, all the information
25 that I was getting through from the surveillance led me
120
1 to believe that that was Nettle Tip.
2 Q. Yes, a positive identification?
3 A. Absolutely, sir.
4 Q. Beyond a shadow of a doubt?
5 A. For me, sir, yes.
6 Q. For you, yes. The information you are getting, you say,
7 comes from surveillance officers?
8 A. That's the only source of information I have, sir.
9 Q. Did you ever look at the surveillance log, the running
10 log? The jury have seen it many times, I am not asking
11 for it to be brought up. Did you see the running log
12 that was there on the screen in the ops room?
13 A. No, sir.
14 Q. You never did?
15 A. I knew it was there but I never looked at it, sir.
16 Q. Any reason why you didn't look at it?
17 A. Because I had an awful lot to do. I was on the phone to
18 Trojan 84; I was trying to advise the DSO; I was
19 listening to the surveillance channel. I did not have
20 time to look up and look at that monitor.
21 Q. Right. You know now, of course, that had you looked at
22 it, you would have seen that this was an unidentified
23 individual throughout; you know that now, do you?
24 A. I understand that's what was written on that screen,
25 sir, but I don't believe that to be the case.
121
1 Q. No. Well, let us be frank, we --
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What do you mean by that last answer:
3 "... I did not understand that to be the case."
4 A. Because of the information that I was getting from the
5 surveillance commentary, that it was possibly identical
6 with, all of those issues, that for me is not
7 an unidentified subject.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: If you had looked up and seen "U/I" on
9 the surveillance log, your response or your reaction to
10 that was: well, I don't agree?
11 A. If I had seen it at that time --
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That would have been your reaction,
13 "I don't agree"?
14 A. Possibly. It could have been something that was just
15 written by the surveillance loggist as a note, I don't
16 know, sir.
17 MR MANSFIELD: You see, the learned Coroner's question does
18 have a bearing on this, doesn't it, because: are you
19 forming an opinion of your own without really taking on
20 board what is actually being said and seen? In other
21 words, just forming an overall impression: he gets off
22 the bus, he is looking a bit dodgy, that kind of thing.
23 Is that how you were building it up?
24 A. No, sir. My sources of information are the speech that
25 is coming over the surveillance channel, when I am being
122
1 (inaudible - coughing) by the surveillance monitor. As
2 I said, I can't remember the exact details of the words,
3 but from the words that were used, that was my
4 impression, that was my belief.
5 Q. I want to put it starkly, you see. Is it now being
6 suggested by those in the operations room if
7 surveillance officers come here and say they never did
8 positively identify, they never used any words that
9 could be misconstrued in that way; are you suggesting
10 they are lying?
11 A. That's not for me to say, sir.
12 Q. Well, there aren't too many options here, do you follow?
13 A. Yes, I do, sir.
14 Q. I'm only going in on this to start with, because this is
15 the thing that you say has gone wrong; this is the only
16 thing that you can put your finger on has gone wrong is
17 identification?
18 A. I can only reiterate the opinion that I formed when
19 I was in that control room, sir.
20 Q. When you were asked by the IPCC about where you formed
21 that from, you weren't able to tell them, were you,
22 exactly where you had got it from?
23 A. My only sources of intelligence were what was coming
24 over the surveillance monitor, what was being said.
25 Q. Yes.
123
1 A. I can't now remember what I said to the IPCC in my
2 interview. It will be written down there, sir.
3 Q. Oh yes, it certainly is. You can't remember what you
4 told them, but what I want to ask you at this stage is
5 whether you recall and ever recalled from whom you
6 obtained that information?
7 A. My only source of information was the surveillance team,
8 sir.
9 Q. What you said, and you can have it up if you like, to
10 the IPCC -- it's exhibit page 305 -- you say in your
11 statement, you were informed by -- it's at the bottom of
12 the page:
13 "... that this was a positive identification?
14 "Answer: Yes.
15 "Question: Who informed you?
16 "Answer: I can't say for certain, as I said it's
17 information that I received over the open phone ... over
18 the open mike saying positive identification or whatever
19 the words exactly were, I can't be sure whatever the
20 exact words."
21 A. I was being asked there who informed me and I said
22 I don't know which surveillance officer it was, because
23 I am sitting in the control room and standing in the
24 control room and the surveillance officers are on the
25 ground. All I am hearing on the radio is a series of
124
1 voices, all I am hearing is the surveillance monitor
2 reiterating what's being said on the surveillance
3 channel.
4 Q. You are not able now, of course, to say what the words
5 were that informed your opinion?
6 A. It's three and a half years ago, sir. I have tried very
7 hard to remember those exact words but I just can't
8 remember the exact details of the exact words.
9 Q. I want to suggest to you clearly there really wasn't any
10 information on which you could base a positive
11 identification. The highest it ever got was "possibly
12 Nettle Tip". Now, just as this is one of the --
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, "possibly identical with".
14 MR MANSFIELD: Sorry, "possibly identical with". That's the
15 highest it ever got.
16 Now, just reflect on that for a moment. Do you
17 think you just may have got it wrong?
18 A. At that time in those circumstances, that's the opinion
19 I formed.
20 Q. I am going to move on. Perhaps I ought to clarify. So
21 you are not prepared to accept that you may have got it
22 wrong; is that right?
23 A. I made those decisions based on the information that
24 I had, I gave the advice based on the information that
25 I had, and at that time I believed that subject to be
125
1 Nettle Tip, sir.
2 Q. Yes. It's an easy question. Is the answer in your case
3 that you do not believe you got it wrong?
4 A. My answer is that I have to base what I say on the
5 information that I am given. I believe what I did was
6 right. I believe what I said was correct. If it
7 subsequently transpires that something is not the same,
8 well, then I can only base what I do on the information
9 that I have at that time.
10 Q. Yes, I appreciate that, and I'm suggesting the
11 information that you had at that time would not have led
12 you to a positive identification?
13 A. For me, sir, it was positive.
14 Q. Well, let me just pass on another stage. If, when he
15 got off the bus at Stockwell, the state of play that you
16 had understood was that it was no higher than possibly
17 identical with, do you follow, that was the state of
18 play, if you had known that?
19 A. Hypothetically.
20 Q. Yes, well, I am not suggesting it's a hypothesis, but
21 I am just going to put it to you, since you don't accept
22 that was your belief. If your belief had been possibly
23 identical with, would you have advised the involvement
24 of SO or CO19?
25 A. "possibly identical with" suggests that that subject
126
1 getting off that bus is possibly identical with a person
2 that we believed to be a suicide terrorist. If we look
3 at the threat and risk that's faced by the officers that
4 are then intending to go and deal with that person, in
5 those circumstances, it doesn't change. I have to
6 advise based on the facts that officers are going to go
7 and deal with a person who is intent on committing mass
8 murder, who only 24 hours previously had attempted to
9 commit mass murder on the transport system. I have
10 thought about this long and hard, and because for me
11 it's a key issue, and I don't believe it would have made
12 any difference to those circumstances, because for me
13 the threat was always there, sir.
14 Q. Yes, I just want to get, so the jury can be clear about
15 the levels of threat and so on and how you envisage it.
16 If in fact therefore it had been possibly identical
17 with, that too would have provided a basis for saying,
18 advising, would it, that SO19 become involved?
19 A. I advised based on the tactics that are available and --
20 Q. Please answer the question. We will come to tactics and
21 what you have advised and what you didn't advise. I'll
22 come to that.
23 If you had believed that it was possibly identical
24 with, would you have advised the involvement and
25 engagement of SO19?
127
1 A. It wouldn't have changed my decision, sir.
2 Q. Right. That's perfectly understandable because, of
3 course, as a firearms officer, the real object of the
4 exercise that day was to prevent somebody who was
5 a bomber the day before and had been identified as being
6 a bomber the day before, or even possibly a bomber from
7 the day before, getting anywhere near the transport
8 system; correct?
9 A. The intention was to safely arrest them.
10 Q. Yes, before they got anywhere near the transport system;
11 correct?
12 A. The intention was to arrest the subjects. The chances
13 of them getting on a transport system increases the
14 threat and increases the risk because of what had
15 happened before. But I don't believe that that was
16 an operational priority at that time. It comes into the
17 consideration. But the decisions are made based on the
18 threat and risk, the advice is given in relation to
19 that, and if a subject comes near an transport system
20 because of what had happened previously, the day before,
21 then it alters the decision-making process.
22 Q. Well, that's what I want to deal with. Because what
23 I want to suggest to you at this stage, so it's entirely
24 clear, is that you -- and I put it to you as the senior
25 tactical adviser -- along with Commander Dick failed to
128
1 plan a tactic to prevent, as far as humanly possible,
2 an identified or possible suspect from engaging with the
3 transport system. Now, do you understand the point I am
4 putting to you?
5 A. I understand it, sir.
6 Q. Right. I just pause for a moment. (Pause)
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: No, carry on, I'll deal with these
8 later.
9 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
10 Before I develop with you, because I'm going to go
11 through with you what were obvious things to have done,
12 not with hindsight but at the time, and I suggest they
13 were your responsibility along with Commander Dick.
14 Do you follow?
15 A. I am the tactical adviser. Commander Dick is the
16 decision-maker, sir.
17 Q. I want to get clear, before we get into what could have
18 happened, I want to deal with you with some general
19 points at the beginning. In other words, what SO19 are
20 trained to do and the difference between various
21 operations.
22 For these purposes could we have your tactical
23 document, please, back up? It's tab 42. We have seen
24 it before. This is a section of it which you had
25 prepared the night before. It's a generic document.
129
1 A. That's correct, sir.
2 Q. As has been pointed out to you already by the learned
3 Coroner, as you will see, "interception outside the
4 stronghold/premises or elsewhere of suicide terrorists".
5 So we are dealing with in this section, or you are,
6 suicide terrorists?
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 Q. It's obvious. Then in brackets you have "spontaneous or
9 pre-planned Kratos"?
10 A. Sir.
11 Q. Is what is written here directed at those situations,
12 covered generically by the term Kratos?
13 A. It could be, sir, yes.
14 Q. No; is it or not? Not could be; is it?
15 A. In relation to stops of subjects or in relation to this
16 operation, sir?
17 Q. No, I am asking the questions. Is this section, 10, all
18 right, is this tailored to Kratos operations?
19 A. No, it's not, sir.
20 Q. It's not. It doesn't say that it's intended for
21 anything broader, does it?
22 A. This document was intended as a discussion document at
23 the outset. It was prepared the day before when we were
24 asked by Superintendent Boutcher to prepare a firearms
25 response, a 24-hour firearms response, to an operation
130
1 that was emerging that day. As that information was
2 emerging, we had absolutely no idea as to what we might
3 then be facing the day before. So this document, with
4 all these, with the non-suicide terrorist options, with
5 these terrorist options, were intended to cover any
6 eventuality, both for the Operation Theseus and also, if
7 necessary, for the spontaneous Kratos operation coming
8 out of the information room downstairs.
9 Q. I'm not going through all 34 pages. I am dealing with
10 this section which has already been highlighted, which,
11 if I may say so, seems to be covering precisely the
12 situation that you might face -- you might face:
13 interception, the need to intercept, outside premises or
14 elsewhere, a suicide terrorist. All right?
15 A. This would follow, sir, from mobile armed support to
16 surveillance. It's not a tactic by itself. It's
17 a tactic to either stop people or conduct containment
18 and challenges, as a result of something happening.
19 Q. Oh yes. Now, all of that wasn't totally unpredictable.
20 Let us go back to 9/11. From 9/11 onwards, one of the
21 most obvious threats that the Metropolitan Police might
22 have to face -- and this was considered on tabletop
23 exercises and all the rest of it -- was a suicide bomber
24 on foot, wasn't it?
25 A. Yes, sir.
131
1 Q. Right. So it's not, as is so often -- and you have said
2 it yourself -- so, as it were, unpredictable that you
3 had not foreseen the possibility of a footborne suicide
4 bomber; that had been something that had been
5 anticipated, hadn't it?
6 A. It's always something that is considered because it's
7 happened elsewhere in the world. So it could transfer
8 and did transfer to us. So as a tactical adviser, what
9 I had to do was consider possible tactics within the
10 resources that we had in order to provide a response for
11 the police commanders. This document and this paragraph
12 is a headline for that.
13 Q. Yes, so I am going to come to what you discussed,
14 because you said it was discussed, in particular with
15 Commander Dick. Of course, in this section, we can see
16 that in fact there are express references, just at the
17 bottom paragraph:
18 "Options 10(a) ... suggests proposed tactical
19 deployments to deal with a suspected suicide bomber on
20 foot."
21 All right?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Just going on with this, I want to ask you, when you set
24 out the options which we can see at the bottom of that
25 page and on the next page, first of all there is
132
1 a section the jury don't have but all I am going to
2 say -- do it in this way: of the nine options here, six
3 of them, in other words those from (d) onwards on the
4 next page, when you, as it were, added comments for the
5 benefit of the senior officers, they either hadn't had
6 any training in any of them or they only had very
7 limited training in all of those, that is (d) onwards?
8 A. Are you talking about the containment and challenge?
9 Q. Yes.
10 A. What that section referred to is that the containment
11 and challenge is tactics that are done almost on a daily
12 basis by --
13 Q. Can I just deal with it in this context. I will have to
14 get it up on screen. We can go through each one. For
15 the benefit of those discussing the document, you have
16 added advantages and disadvantages for each one, haven't
17 you?
18 A. Yes, I have, sir.
19 Q. From the (d) onwards, one of the things you have added
20 is that the tactic hasn't been practised?
21 A. It hadn't been practised in relation to the challenges
22 of suicide terrorists. Containment and challenge is
23 something that is done all the time. At that time --
24 you have to consider the threat and the risk, and the
25 issues faced by armed officers at that time were in the
133
1 developmental stage.
2 Q. Yes. So when this was discussed, the only three that in
3 fact had been, as it were, practised were the first
4 three, all of them stops; do you follow?
5 A. I follow what you are saying, sir, but containment and
6 challenge is something that CO19 do all the time.
7 Q. Well, I have to come to that in a moment, as to the
8 difference, and what was going on this day and of course
9 what was in the minds of firearms officers is another
10 matter.
11 I want, first of all, in the context of this
12 document, what is involved in a stop, first of all,
13 whoever does it? Or are there differences?
14 A. There are differences. It depends on the level of
15 training.
16 Q. Can I go straight to the obvious one, since CO19 SFO
17 officers are involved here: a stop by plain clothes CO19
18 SFO officers in covert armed response vehicles. What
19 does a stop by them actually mean and involve on the
20 ground?
21 A. It means getting themselves at the point of deployment
22 between the threat and the public in order to protect
23 the public. Now, an actual stop can be either
24 a containment and challenge, fairly close, or an actual
25 armed interception. And the containment and challenge,
134
1 the distance of that will depend on the threat and risk
2 that is faced at that time.
3 Q. So let us take it stage by stage, because this may
4 affect what firearms officers thought they were doing.
5 You do appreciate this, do you?
6 A. Yes, sir.
7 Q. Right, because they are being trained by you and others
8 in these tactics; correct?
9 A. Yes, sir.
10 Q. So if they hear the word "stop", what are they going to
11 interpret it to mean, one of these three?
12 A. SFO officers will interpret a stop as an armed
13 interception at that point.
14 Q. Right, now, an armed interception at that point, what
15 does that mean?
16 A. To an SFO officer, there is a difference between
17 an interception and an intervention.
18 Q. Right, what is it?
19 A. If I can explain, an interception is where firearms
20 officers deploy against an indirect threat, and that
21 would be a person walking down the street just carrying
22 a firearm, they have a firearm in their pocket; they are
23 a threat because they possess an illegal firearm, but
24 they are not posing a direct threat to anybody else. So
25 that would be an interception.
135
1 Q. Can I take it in stages. How would they do that? These
2 words have been interchangeable up until this minute.
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. If an officer is doing -- SO19 are doing an armed
5 interception on an indirect threat, what actually do
6 they do? I am sorry, the members of jury would like to
7 know. Do they come up in front of you and point
8 a weapon at you or do they say something? What do they
9 do?
10 A. It depends on the threat that's faced at the time. The
11 officers have to fall back on their training and I can't
12 say what an individual officer will do at that time in
13 a particular set of circumstances, because it's only
14 them that can pick, almost, the most appropriate level
15 of force, the most appropriate place to do it, the
16 most -- whether or not they are going to issue
17 a challenge, once they know the threat is facing them at
18 that time.
19 Q. Yes.
20 A. So an order to stop will depend on what threat is faced
21 and what level of training they have. Now, an SFO
22 officer can do everything because that's the level of
23 training that they have. They can do a stop, they can
24 do an intervention, they can do an interception, they
25 can do a stop and challenge, because of the level of
136
1 training that they have.
2 Q. I am just going through it with you now, to see whether
3 in fact what you have in mind is what the firearms
4 officers will say they had in mind. Do you see?
5 Now, a stop, according to you, at least there is two
6 concepts: an interception which you define as being
7 intercepting when there is an indirect threat, and it
8 will be up to the officer how he deals with it; is that
9 fair?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. So it might involve him saying, "Hey stop", or it might
12 involve him just pulling a weapon. It might involve a
13 whole range of options.
14 A. There is one thing, issue, here, if we are talking about
15 it in relation to this, everything that we do here has
16 to be based against the threat and risk that was being
17 faced at that time and it's really not a matter of going
18 up to a person and saying, "Hey, stop", because we are
19 not dealing with a firearms threat here. What we are
20 dealing with are deadly and determined people who
21 intended to commit mass murder. It's not a normal
22 firearms operation, there is a lot more to it than that,
23 and that's why if an order to stop is given, it's to
24 an SFO officer a challenge. It's to an SFO officer
25 a stop, and they will either issue a challenge --
137
1 Q. Wait a minute. Is it a challenge or not?
2 A. They will either issue a challenge or they will either
3 confront the person depending on the circumstances that
4 exist at that point and only they, only they, can make
5 that determination.
6 Q. Oh yes, we will have to come to that obviously. But
7 these are trained officers, and these are words that you
8 are using in your document; so stop so far, I have dealt
9 with interception insofar as you can define it; what's
10 the difference between that and an intervention?
11 A. An intervention is where there is a direct threat. If
12 we akin it to a firearms operation, it would be almost
13 like a bank robbery, where a guard is being threatened
14 by an officer, where a firearm is actually being pointed
15 at a person.
16 That is being a direct threat to another person.
17 Q. Right.
18 A. Now -- sorry.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Go on, you are going to be asked to
20 tell us what an intervention is.
21 MR MANSFIELD: That was the question and I think you have
22 just answered it.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I am not sure, what does it involve
24 doing?
25 A. Again, it's interposing themselves, that's the firearms
138
1 officers in this situation, between the threat and the
2 public, and --
3 MR MANSFIELD: So on this day, was this an interception or
4 an intervention?
5 A. If CO19 had been doing it, it would have been
6 an intervention, because the threat and risk that was
7 faced at that time was dealing with -- now, this is me
8 talking here based on this tactical advice document.
9 What the officers faced down on the Underground station,
10 only they can answer, because only they can relate the
11 threat that was posed to them.
12 Q. I am going to ask you questions, because you, as it
13 were, advised sending them down. I'll come to that
14 decision, plainly.
15 As far as you are concerned, therefore, these
16 officers were intervening because of a direct threat; is
17 that right?
18 A. That was the perception. That was the knowledge. The
19 person who had got off that bus was, we believed to be
20 Nettle Tip, and that person was a suicide terrorist.
21 Q. Do you think there is a risk here that what happened on
22 this day, and I am going to suggest you added to this
23 risk by what you have said to the officers in charge of
24 teams; at the moment he gets off the bus, he is
25 virtually dead. You have identified him as a terrorist
139
1 from the day before, and therefore the level of risk is
2 so high that he is never going to come out of the tube
3 alive. Do you think that's possible?
4 A. I wholeheartedly disagree with you, sir. The SFO
5 officers are probably the most highly trained officers
6 that there are in the country, firearms officers --
7 Q. And restrained, are they?
8 A. They are very restrained. They consider what they are
9 doing, they knew what they were dealing with on that
10 morning, they knew that they were dealing with suicide
11 terrorist and they knew what the order was that they
12 were to undertake, and that was an interception,
13 an armed interception at that point.
14 Q. Or intervention?
15 A. Or intervention.
16 Q. Well, which?
17 A. Only those officers can determine it at that point. The
18 order was given to stop. Officers will deploy, and when
19 they deploy, they will see the threat that faces them at
20 that point. I am standing in the control room. I am
21 saying to them "stop". They know what that means,
22 because of their training, because of their expertise,
23 because they carry out stops, they carry out containment
24 and challenges, they carry out interventions almost on
25 a daily basis.
140
1 Q. At the moment I am dealing with the term "stop" as you
2 have put it in here, that is the tab 42 tac document;
3 and we have dealt with interception as you defined it;
4 intervention as you have defined it; then of course all
5 the other options, (d) onwards, are contain and
6 challenge.
7 Can you explain, as you have not used the word
8 "stop" there, but the same unit could be involved, it's
9 the last one:
10 "Contain and challenge by plain clothes SFOs in
11 covert ARVs."
12 What's the difference there?
13 A. The intention of these last six options were -- the
14 tactics developed there because of the threat that is
15 faced is to contain and challenge. Now, in normal
16 firearms operations, it's always identify, locate,
17 contain. But because of the threat that's faced around
18 the risk of explosives, around suicide terrorisms, there
19 is an issue about how far we need to be away in order to
20 ensure the safety of officers, ensure the safety of the
21 public.
22 So the contain and challenge in this, as opposed to
23 a normal firearms operation, means that we have to
24 consider the distances that officers may have to
25 initially issue that challenge from.
141
1 Q. Now, the word has been used, and by others besides
2 yourself about this operation, that in fact what was
3 being ordered was a conventional arrest. Is that what
4 you thought was being ordered?
5 A. By conventional arrest, do you mean using conventional
6 tactics, yes.
7 Q. What are conventional tactics?
8 A. Normal firearms tactics.
9 Q. Yes, what are they?
10 A. It depends on the threat that is there at the time.
11 There are hundreds of tactics. Normal conventional
12 tactics are firearms tactics, it's what's written in the
13 ACPO manual, it's what's written in this document, they
14 are all normal tactics --
15 Q. What are the normal tactics in this case, would you have
16 expected to be adopted?
17 A. Either a containment and challenge, an intervention or
18 an interception, depending upon the threat and risk that
19 is faced by the officers at that time.
20 Q. I will go through those so that we know when the
21 firearms officers come exactly how they work.
22 So depending upon the threat that they face, it's
23 either going to be an interception because it's
24 an indirect threat, or an interception because they
25 perceive a direct threat, or it's going to be contain
142
1 and challenge?
2 A. I can't stipulate what tactics those officers will --
3 Q. No, no.
4 A. They are tactics that are available to them.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Those are the choices?
6 A. They are the choices, sorry. Absolutely.
7 That if you say to a firearms officer, if you say to
8 an SFO officer, "Stop that person", then they will
9 deploy, they will assess the situation, they will assess
10 the threat and risk, and they will deploy the tactic
11 most appropriate in those circumstances.
12 MR MANSFIELD: Now, the reason I want to go through these
13 is, if they are going to assess a threat which requires
14 interception, it's the indirect version, they don't
15 actually see a weapon but they, what? On the indirect?
16 A. Sorry, I don't quite understand.
17 Q. How are they going to make a judgment that this is
18 an intercept case?
19 A. They can only work on what happens in front of them.
20 This is one of the challenges, and one of the issues
21 that has been discussed right from the outset in
22 relation to suicide terrorism, and it's something that
23 is discussed around the world, that for normal firearms
24 operation, you can see a threat, you can see a person
25 pointing a gun at you. If you are dealing with suicide
143
1 terrorism, whether it be in this country or anywhere
2 else, that threat isn't immediately available.
3 Q. Right --
4 A. Isn't immediately viewable. So the officers have to
5 assess --
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Not visible?
7 A. Not visible, sir, sorry. They have to assess what's in
8 front of them.
9 MR MANSFIELD: I want to examine this with you, as to how
10 the policy has been developed to deal with this
11 situation.
12 You are aware that other countries have a very
13 different approach to this dilemma or difficulty, aren't
14 you?
15 A. There are -- I can't speak for what other approaches
16 other countries have. I am aware of what they do,
17 because I have researched it, but what they choose to --
18 responses they choose to develop --
19 Q. In Israel where they have been dealing with this sort of
20 threat for some time, they have very different rules of
21 engagement, don't they?
22 A. It's a very different society, sir.
23 Q. The answer is yes, they do?
24 A. Yes, sir.
25 Q. One of the rules of engagement that they have is that
144
1 you don't shoot someone dead unless you have some way of
2 detecting the presence of a bomb?
3 A. I couldn't even begin to answer that, sir, because
4 I just don't know.
5 Q. You don't know?
6 A. No. Not to that level.
7 Q. Who has done the research under Barbara Wilding in
8 relation to this?
9 A. There are a number of people that were involved. My
10 involvement in this was in relation to
11 Metropolitan Police tactics in relation to the response
12 to suicide terrorists.
13 Q. Well, if you are going to train people to respond to
14 something they can't see, how are they going to make
15 a judgment? I put it in this context: you are not
16 suggesting that firearms officers shoot somebody just in
17 case they are a suicide bomber, are you.
18 A. That would be ridiculous, sir, no.
19 Q. It would be ridiculous, and therefore you have to train
20 people to carefully identify the threat, if they can --
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. -- of what they are facing?
23 A. That is the essence of the training. That's the essence
24 of the training that we give to specialist firearms
25 officers, that we give to ARV officers, that we give to
145
1 TST officers. It's about assessment of the threat at
2 the point that they deploy.
3 Q. Now, I want to distinguish here so it's clear. There is
4 a situation that you have developed calling it
5 Clydesdale, in which of course there is intelligence.
6 It may be wrong but there is intelligence that somebody
7 is not only a suicide bomber, but is actually intent on
8 carrying it out because they have the device with them,
9 are you following?
10 A. This wasn't a Clydesdale operation, sir.
11 Q. I appreciate that, and we will find out later what the
12 officers thought about it. I want to distinguish
13 a situation in which you have intelligence that the
14 person is a suicide bomber, and they have the means of
15 carrying it out with them, in other words they have
16 a bomb with them, either in a rucksack or in a suicide
17 vest or however it's carried; and in those circumstances
18 under Clydesdale, a DSO may give an order for a critical
19 shot. Even though the officer on the ground may not
20 have seen it, he still has to assess it, but it can be
21 given by the DSO?
22 A. That is an option under those circumstances. The DSO
23 can make that decision based on the information that
24 they have at that time.
25 Q. You have made very clear that this isn't a Clydesdale
146
1 operation, and therefore it wasn't one in which any of
2 the officers could have been expected to be told by
3 anyone in that sense that they could deliver a critical
4 shot?
5 A. This wasn't a Clydesdale.
6 Q. Now, as far as, and I know the word unfortunately is
7 used generically, people-borne, and I leave vehicles out
8 of it for the moment, although there was a vehicle,
9 people-borne exercises prior to July 2005, was a DSO
10 involved in those exercises? That is people-borne as
11 opposed to Clydesdale?
12 A. I don't know what exercise you are talking about, sir.
13 Q. All the training, all the exercises, tabletop and
14 otherwise, all the legal advices that were being
15 obtained about the legality and so on, did any of that,
16 that is people-borne Kratos, I want to know what your
17 understanding was prior to July 2005, did that involve
18 a DSO or not?
19 A. My understanding of person-borne Kratos was in relation
20 to spontaneous emerging intelligence. Person-borne at
21 that time was to deal with pieces of intelligence that
22 would come into a control room. There was an assessment
23 of that information, and then the designated senior
24 officer who had been contacted would make
25 a determination as to the most appropriate tactic.
147
1 Q. You think that your understanding was, and we have a lot
2 of documentation, that a DSO was in fact involved in
3 both operations?
4 A. That they were on the morning of the 22nd, because we
5 had Commander Carter dealing with the --
6 Q. No, no, I will come to the operation, but before the
7 operation on this day, so this, you see, I am asking you
8 as to whether a firearms officer, knowing that a DSO is
9 involved, would automatically understand that a DSO is
10 in a position on a Kratos operation?
11 A. No, absolutely not. The DSO function there is to decide
12 the tactics. All the firearms officers on that morning
13 knew that a DSO was involved, but they knew it wasn't
14 a Kratos operation, they knew this was
15 an intelligence-gathering operation, a manhunt for the
16 people who had been involved on 21 July.
17 Now, this operation could have taken us absolutely
18 anywhere, and eventually it did. On the days to come
19 after that, there was operations all over London. So
20 the mere fact that a DSO is involved wouldn't suggest to
21 the officers that this is a Kratos; in fact exactly the
22 opposite.
23 Q. If any of them suggested that they did think it was a
24 Kratos, that's a misunderstanding by them, is it?
25 A. I can't say what the officers were thinking. All I can
148
1 say is what the training was, and what the intention of
2 the operation was.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: All you can say is that by July 2005
4 the fact that a DSO had been appointed did not
5 necessarily mean that this was a Kratos operation?
6 A. Yes, sir.
7 MR MANSFIELD: Would you expect in a briefing that those
8 doing the briefing would make sure that the firearms
9 officers would be aware that the appointment of a DSO
10 did not mean it was necessarily Kratos or Clydesdale?
11 Would you expect them to know that, to be told that?
12 A. The briefing should give the officers the required
13 information in order for them to go out and do their
14 job.
15 Q. Yes, and you appreciate that of course facing a threat
16 depends upon a number of things, not only what you think
17 you see, but also what you have been told and informed,
18 doesn't it?
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 Q. In fact, it's what's called a mindset. You don't
21 suddenly come on to the scene without prior information,
22 and what you have been given in a briefing is extremely
23 important, isn't it?
24 A. Absolutely, sir.
25 Q. Yes. First of all, did you discover that day, that is
149
1 the 22nd, how many shots had been fired?
2 A. I don't know if it was on the 22nd or the 23rd, sir, no.
3 Q. All right.
4 A. But --
5 Q. In that time period?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. Some time on the 22nd or 23rd, you discovered how many
8 shots were fired?
9 A. (Witness nods).
10 Q. How many did you discover had been fired?
11 A. I actually -- I actually don't know the number, sir.
12 That's the honest truth. At this time I couldn't tell
13 you the number that had been fired.
14 Q. Do you still not know the number that had been fired?
15 A. In honesty, no, I don't, sir.
16 Q. I want to put to you that it's a rather shockingly large
17 number. Nine shots were fired. I want to ask you your
18 reaction, as you didn't know the number before I put it
19 to you. Are you shocked by that number?
20 A. That point you are going to have to raise with the
21 officers, sir --
22 Q. No, are you shocked by the number of shots fired by
23 highly trained restrained officers?
24 A. No, I am not, because I don't know what they were facing
25 there at the time. I don't know what the threat was at

1 the time --
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Or what they thought.
3 A. Or what they thought the threat was at the time.
4 I can't put myself in the minds of those officers and
5 therefore I can't make a determination as to how many
6 shots would be or wouldn't be appropriate. That is
7 a question that only those officers can answer.
8 MR MANSFIELD: They are part of the training where
9 a critical shot is ordered, and I am not suggesting
10 that's what happened here, it wasn't ordered, and you
11 are saying it's not Kratos or Clydesdale; but where it's
12 ordered, the training suggests that one shot to the
13 brain stem, that's the whole point of it, with the
14 ammunition that had been issued, hollow tip, that day,
15 is enough to incapacitate. Were you aware of that?
16 A. That's absolutely wrong, sir.
17 Q. I see. What's wrong about it?
18 A. There is a confusion around what the tactic is, there is
19 a confusion around what the weapon is, there is
20 a confusion around what the round is.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The ammunition?
22 A. I apologise, sir, the ammunition. And those words are
23 written for a totally separate set of circumstances.
24 MR MANSFIELD: Oh yes, the delivery of the critical shot.
25 But what happened here was the delivery of a critical
151
1 shot. You do know that, don't you?
2 A. What happened here is that the officers faced a threat,
3 the officers perceived a threat, and the officers took
4 action which they believed was appropriate in the
5 circumstances.
6 I have already said I can't put myself in the minds
7 of those officers. Only they can answer that because
8 I don't know that threat, sir.
9 Q. Yes. I am not suggesting that Commander Dick ordered
10 a critical shot. What I am dealing with is the training
11 situation where a critical shot is ordered and
12 delivered; they are not trained to deliver nine of them,
13 they are trained on the basis that one is perfectly
14 sufficient?
15 A. No, they are not, sir.
16 Q. I see. So what are they told about the delivery of
17 a critical shot with this kind of ammunition?
18 A. I may have to stray into tactical issues here, which
19 I don't think I can answer in relation to weapons,
20 ammunitions and tactics. But all I can say is that the
21 officers must -- I am being very careful of my words
22 here, sir, so I don't reveal anything -- that the
23 officers can only deploy in accordance with the
24 circumstances that they face. They can only fire the
25 number of rounds in accordance with the circumstances
152
1 that they face at that particular time.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Can I ask you, I'll try and be helpful
3 anyway: you are familiar with the characteristics and
4 purpose of the low grain ammunition that we have been
5 talking about?
6 A. I am aware of the round that was --
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You are aware of what it is intended to
8 do?
9 A. Yes, sir.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: We are told, we have been told several
11 times, that if you have an identified risk of a suicide
12 bomb and an imminent explosion, the training is, and the
13 requirement is, not for a torso shot which may not be
14 effective as you have explained to us already, but
15 a head shot, and that that head shot is intended,
16 I think the expression is, a brain stem shot. Right?
17 A. Sir, yes.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That is, as you have told us, intended
19 to totally incapacitate the person?
20 A. That's the intention of it.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Now, I know you are not a doctor, but
22 if in fact the first shot is successful, and does
23 actually destroy the brain stem, what is likely to
24 happen to the recipient of that shot?
25 A. That they would be unable to detonate a device.
153
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: They would be dead, wouldn't they?
2 A. They would be dead, sir, yes.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Let us not beat about the bush.
4 A. Yes, sir.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The first shot that does its job,
6 namely incapacitates, will kill?
7 A. If it achieves that, yes, sir.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It will kill.
9 A. Yes, sir.
10 MR MANSFIELD: Just again back to the tactical document
11 for a moment, you have indicated resources here, but
12 I want to ask you about one resource which isn't
13 mentioned on this particular document that I suggest was
14 available, at least according to other evidence.
15 Besides obviously vehicles like cars, whether they
16 are covert or overt, and obviously as it has got on the
17 next page, armoured vehicles are available as well or at
18 least one?
19 A. Sir, yes.
20 Q. Was an armoured vehicle available that night?
21 A. The armoured vehicles are there 24 hours a day should
22 they be needed.
23 Q. We can include those in the range of options. Something
24 that is not mentioned here are motorcycles?
25 A. Yes, sir.
154
1 Q. They were available, weren't they?
2 A. Yes, sir.
3 Q. They are extremely useful for -- can I just go through
4 it. A motorcycle might carry one or two people; is that
5 right?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. So you could have -- I ask you this: how many
8 motorcycles might be attached to a team if you wanted to
9 use them?
10 A. If I wanted to, any number could be attached.
11 Q. Any number could be. So you take the officers out of
12 a car and put them on a motorcycle?
13 A. Yes, sir.
14 Q. That's how it works?
15 A. Yes, sir.
16 Q. So all the SFO officers are trained to drive a car and
17 ride motorcycles?
18 A. No, sir.
19 Q. So some of them are?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. You can put them on -- and those officers who in fact,
22 as it were, then switch to riding a motorcycle or being
23 carried on a motorcycle, take their arms with them?
24 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
25 Q. Because that's the whole point of the exercise?
155
1 A. Yes, sir.
2 Q. In a situation in an inner London area, on a mobile
3 armed support, having motorcycles available to weave
4 their way through the traffic is extraordinarily useful,
5 isn't it?
6 A. Yes, sir.
7 Q. How many were put on duty for Scotia Road?
8 A. There initially were two, sir.
9 Q. Two motorcycles?
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 Q. When you say initially, do you mean before they got to
12 Nightingale Lane or after they got to Nightingale Lane
13 or after everything had finished?
14 A. At Nightingale Lane there were two, sir.
15 Q. There were two. What this means, does it not, in
16 practical terms, is that if in fact the cars can't get
17 somewhere quickly enough, the motorcycles can be ordered
18 ahead, is that right?
19 A. They are a means of delivery, sir.
20 Q. They are a means of delivery, so that if in fact,
21 therefore, the position was that by the time he got off
22 at Brixton, as you thought but you didn't know, you
23 thought that the SO19 officers were at the TA Centre,
24 one of the quickest ways of getting people ahead to the
25 bus that he's on is on motorcycles?
156
1 A. That's correct, sir.
2 Q. Whose decision would that be to use them to go ahead?
3 A. It would probably be the team leader's, sir, and the
4 tactical advisers on the ground.
5 Q. But of course you are aware of it, so you are able to,
6 as it were, put your pennorth in on this one and say
7 either to Commander Dick or to the Silver, Mr Purser, or
8 to Trojan 84: look, I think as it's still, you know,
9 part of the rush hour, 9.30, there is still heavy
10 traffic in London, although it's probably throughout the
11 day, but it's a busy period, isn't it, 9.30?
12 A. Yes, sir.
13 Q. Did you consider saying to Trojan 84, "I think we will
14 have the motorcycles on this job as he's already on
15 a bus"?
16 A. The motorcycles were there at the briefing. On
17 deployment to the Territorial Army Centre and now this
18 is my recollection and my reconstruction, as times have
19 developed, because of the equipment that we had at that
20 time, they were not able to get any of the
21 communications, because of the fact --
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Back to radios again?
23 A. -- because of the fact that they were on motorbikes.
24 Therefore they weren't aware of the follows, and they
25 never took any part in any of the follows at any time.
157
1 MR MANSFIELD: I just want to examine this. The question
2 actually was: did you ask Trojan 84 on the ground, now
3 you are -- on the assumption that you made that they
4 were back at the Territorial Army Centre, he is on
5 a bus, he is off a bus and he is getting back on a bus.
6 Did you say, first of all, to Trojan 84, "Get those
7 motorcycles on the road"?
8 A. The decision in relation to --
9 Q. I am sorry to intervene. You give very long answers.
10 I'm trying to be patient. Did you ask Trojan 84 to send
11 the motorcycles in?
12 A. No, because that's not my decision.
13 Q. I appreciate that. I am not suggesting it is your
14 decision. It is merely did you ask Trojan --
15 A. I said no, because it's not my decision.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Could he have done it?
17 A. Yes, he could have.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: If he was down the road somewhere in
19 the car, could he have contacted them?
20 A. Trojan 84?
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
22 A. At that briefing he could have done.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: No, once he was out on the road
24 conducting --
25 A. No, I'm sorry, he couldn't. They had totally lost
158
1 communications, sir.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: They had lost contact. It had crossed
3 my mind, actually, Mr Mansfield. Officers carrying
4 firearms on a motorcycle are likely to compromise the
5 covert nature of the follow.
6 MR MANSFIELD: I was coming to that, because I don't think
7 this is the Wild West, and going down on a
8 Harley-Davidson with a machine gun on the handle bars.
9 I have hopefully assumed, it's a perfectly
10 legitimate point, that those on motorcycles have their
11 weapons secreted; is that right?
12 A. Yes, sir.
13 Q. I'm not going to ask for tactical reasons where they put
14 them.
15 Just going back a fraction: when was it discovered
16 that it was impossible to make contact with the
17 motorcycles?
18 A. Not until after.
19 Q. After what?
20 A. I didn't become aware of this until quite some time
21 afterwards, because what then happened, because they had
22 lost communications, I then re-deployed them after that
23 event.
24 Q. You see, even at the smallest detail, that's really
25 something that went wrong, isn't it?
159
1 A. Communications break down all the time, sir, so if
2 communications failure -- the communications failed.
3 Q. It's no use --
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I thought you meant they weren't even
5 equipped with relevant radios.
6 A. No, they had hand-held Cougars, sir, which the range is
7 probably very, very --
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Then you are telling me they just don't
9 have the necessary communication facilities?
10 A. At that time they didn't have the necessary facilities.
11 MR MANSFIELD: I want to be clear, because you see, if they
12 are present at the briefing at Nightingale Lane; yes.
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. I don't know whether you -- perhaps you know it now, not
15 every member of the team got to the TA Centre; do you
16 know that? They didn't all end up at the TA centre.
17 Some did, some didn't?
18 A. Yes, that's correct, sir.
19 Q. So at the point at which he is on and off a bus in
20 Brixton, where were the motorcycles?
21 A. I don't know, sir. They had been totally lost
22 communications with.
23 Q. They had not been sent off into the ether, had they?
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, they probably finished up at some
25 stage at the TA Centre not knowing what was going on.
160
1 A. Yes.
2 MR MANSFIELD: Is that right? Do you know that?
3 A. They actually ended up at Stockwell because they had
4 managed -- they had stopped, put a phone call in, and
5 I am assuming this, and then managed to find out where
6 the rest of the team had gone and caught up. And it was
7 at that point that I contacted them and said -- and re-
8 deployed them.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: But they were not able to contribute
10 anything to the follow?
11 A. Absolutely none, sir.
12 MR MANSFIELD: But of course, it is all very well to say
13 now: I am sorry about this, the Cougar didn't work, they
14 are out of range or whatever the problem was that day,
15 just re-deployed them.
16 Of course they could have played a very vital part
17 in this exercise, couldn't they?
18 A. They could have done, sir, yes, had they been able to
19 contact.
20 Q. The vital part they could have played, are we to
21 understand there are two motorcycles?
22 A. On that operation, yes.
23 Q. If there are more, please say. Were there three?
24 A. No.
25 Q. Just two?
161
1 A. Two.
2 Q. Two, with two people on each.
3 A. No, with one person on each, sir.
4 Q. They would have been able to get to the Stockwell tube
5 station long before the cars, wouldn't they, if they had
6 been in contact?
7 A. That's it. If they had been in contact then they would
8 have been.
9 Q. That's the point I am trying to make. Obviously you
10 didn't know he was going to get off at Stockwell, but
11 they could have been within very easy range of the bus
12 wherever it stopped, were it necessary?
13 A. Again, I can't really answer that, because I didn't know
14 about the communications, I didn't know where they were,
15 I didn't know how they were going to travel. Yes, of
16 course they could, because they are motorcycles and
17 motorcycles get through traffic reasonably quickly.
18 Q. I just want to move to the firearms teams themselves and
19 the exercise that was being conducted with them. You do
20 appreciate that if a DSO in New Scotland Yard removed
21 from the scene is going to be given the responsibility
22 of taking all the decisions, that DSO has to be provided
23 with the best possible information?
24 A. Yes, sir.
25 Q. Up to date information?
162
1 A. Yes, sir.
2 Q. In a fast-time crime in action which police are having
3 to deal with, unfortunately, quite regularly?
4 A. Yes, sir.
5 Q. If a decision is based on -- sorry, if the decision that
6 we are concerned with is who is going to do the arrest,
7 then you have to know who is available to do the arrest,
8 don't you?
9 A. The DSO will make a decision on what resource that they
10 want to do -- it's CO19, the DSO will say to me: I want
11 CO19 to do the intervention. I will then call up
12 Trojan 84 and the team leader and they will deploy the
13 units. The units they have on the ground.
14 Q. Yes. I think it was put to you before in a slightly
15 different way but I want to deal with this. Plainly if
16 you don't have an SO19 team there because they are stuck
17 back at the Territorial Army Centre because the gates
18 have been locked and they can't get there, the officer
19 in charge needs to know that they are unavailable;
20 correct?
21 A. I am feeding information all the time to the DSO.
22 Q. Just answer the question. The DSO needs to know they
23 are unavailable; yes?
24 A. She needs to know where they are, sir, yes.
25 Q. So do you?
163
1 A. I give an instruction to, and I apologise for giving
2 long answers, but I just think it's important that I get
3 these points out, that I give instructions to Trojan 84
4 and -- who then gives instructions to the team leader.
5 I don't know where those units are all the time. I say
6 to Trojan 84: brief. So they pick Nightingale Lane.
7 I then say to them: right, your area of responsibility
8 is Scotia Road. They will then move their units forward
9 to Scotia Road, and report back to me when they are
10 there, when they are in position.
11 Q. We have understood all of that and that is very
12 straightforward. I have given you time to explain it,
13 we understand that. Once the mobile armed support is
14 supposed to be going -- when does mobile armed support
15 for surveillance begin?
16 A. At the beginning of the operation, sir.
17 Q. When's that?
18 A. When the operation commences.
19 Q. Yes, when is that in this case?
20 A. Mobile armed support to surveillance can be at any time.
21 At the briefing, they are still providing mobile armed
22 support to surveillance.
23 Q. When does it begin in this case?
24 A. Support to surveillance, mobile armed support to
25 surveillance is not a definitive time or definitive
164
1 distance. The support can be applied either very close
2 or far away.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, they wouldn't be in a position to
4 exercise it or use it until they were briefed?
5 A. No. Once they have been briefed, sir, then -- but even
6 while they are briefing, if something happens and the
7 team leader has contacted the surveillance, then they
8 are there in a position, albeit slightly far away, to
9 provide that support should it be necessary.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Once they have been briefed, they are
11 ready to go and they are available from then on?
12 A. Yes, sir.
13 MR MANSFIELD: So once you have, on what you say is
14 an indication that this is possibly identical with, in
15 other words there is -- somebody has left the premises
16 who's possibly identical; yes? You are aware of that,
17 somebody leaving?
18 A. (Witness nods).
19 Q. Cressida Dick was aware of somebody leaving, wasn't she?
20 A. I don't know when she was aware that somebody was
21 leaving, because she forms that in her own mind. I was
22 told earlier on that when the person was getting on the
23 bus.
24 Q. That's what you were told, but in fact if she had been,
25 as it were -- I am going to put a scenario to you. Pat
165
1 the surveillance officer waves or speaks loudly to the
2 group of senior officers including you and including
3 Mr Boutcher and including Cressida Dick, that somebody
4 has come out, then she would know pretty soon, wouldn't
5 she?
6 A. Only she can answer that, sir.
7 Q. Did you see that happen?
8 A. I personally didn't but I wasn't paying attention.
9 There was an awful lot of things going on in the room.
10 I don't see what everybody's doing.
11 Q. Did you see anybody come out at any stage? Were you
12 ever informed that anybody had come out?
13 A. I was aware that people had come out of the address,
14 yes, sir.
15 Q. At the time that it happened?
16 A. Whether or not it was at the time that it happened or
17 whether or not it was afterwards, I don't know now, sir.
18 Q. When this person came out and you were made aware pretty
19 soon afterwards, 9.34, somewhere around there, you were
20 aware that he had come out and he was possibly
21 identical; is that fair?
22 A. At some time along that line, yes, sir.
23 Q. So you would want mobile armed support to really be on
24 their way at this stage, would you not?
25 A. They have to maintain a safe distance.
166
1 Q. Yes?
2 A. However long that distance is, it depends on the
3 circumstances, but once a person is identified, then
4 they will start to make ground.
5 Q. Yes. Did it cross your mind that perhaps this person
6 shouldn't be allowed to get on a bus?
7 A. That's a decision for the DSO, sir.
8 Q. No, did it cross your mind, given that the threshold you
9 have described includes a possible identical with, as
10 well as positive identification? Did it cross your mind
11 that this person should be stopped from getting on
12 a bus?
13 A. I can only answer -- I can't remember it crossing my
14 mind, sir.
15 Q. No, so the answer is, and I'll have to deal with the
16 beginning in a little more detail, but I am just for the
17 moment dealing with 9.34 onwards, it didn't occur to you
18 then that he would have to be stopped from getting on
19 a bus. Did it occur to you then that you ought to at
20 least inform Trojan 84 that he ought to start making
21 some preparations to stop this individual now he's on
22 a bus?
23 A. I made phone calls to Trojan 84 throughout that journey.
24 When those phone calls were, I made some by landline and
25 some were done on the mobile phone, and at some time
167
1 along that, we talked about tactics, we talked about
2 following the subject, we talked about --
3 Q. Did you say to Trojan 84 -- never mind the general chat,
4 and we will come back to what else you may have said --
5 did you say to Trojan 84: on your bike or in the car,
6 whatever the phrase is.
7 A. I believe at some time during that I probably would
8 have. It's a normal thing for me to say, "Are you
9 getting this, are you receiving this, start following".
10 Q. You have said so many times: this would have happened,
11 that would have happened. We have absolutely no record,
12 of course, of exactly what did happen, and you don't
13 have any memory of saying to Trojan 84, "You had better
14 get moving"?
15 A. I had a number of conversations with him about the
16 subjects, but exactly what I was talking about and
17 exactly what we were describing and exactly what the
18 details of the conversation were, I don't know, but all
19 I can say is it would be normal practice for me to say
20 this is happening, let us --
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What we really need to know,
22 Mr Esposito, is this: plainly at some stage CO19 got
23 into a follow. We know that because we know they
24 finished up at Stockwell. I think what we really need
25 to know is: when were they started? And where was
168
1 Jean Charles de Menezes at that time?
2 A. I don't know, sir. That's the honest answer. I don't
3 know at what time they were started and I don't know --
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Who started them? You, I would have
5 thought?
6 A. It would probably have been me.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well.
8 MR MANSFIELD: Well, it would probably have been you, but
9 maybe it wasn't?
10 A. If the team leader is listening and he hears the same as
11 I do on the radio --
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What, that he is on a bus?
13 A. That he is on a bus, that it's probably identical with
14 or that's our subject, then they are very likely to take
15 it on their own initiative and commence the follow.
16 MR MANSFIELD: You would need to know about it?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. So when was it?
19 A. I have said, I don't know, because we made a series of
20 phone calls along that timeline, but I can't equate it
21 to a time, sir.
22 Q. What I want to suggest is actually from the moment he
23 got off the bus in Brixton and got back on again, you
24 didn't actually know where the firearms teams were in
25 any detail at all, did you?
169
1 A. No, that's not correct, because I had the phone line
2 with Trojan 84, that he was giving me various reports
3 about where they were, he was giving me various reports
4 about the position they were in the road. I said
5 earlier that there was a series of phone calls.
6 Q. Yes?
7 A. And at some time Trojan 84 needed to speak to
8 surveillance, so he put the phone down on me in order to
9 speak to surveillance. And then he called me back. So
10 in that position, in that continuum there, I had no
11 communications with them. It may have been for
12 a minute, it may have been for two minutes, I don't
13 know.
14 Q. Do you think on reflection it would have been better,
15 had you got not a picture on the wall of exactly where
16 every officer was, but a much clearer picture when it
17 comes to Stockwell exactly where the firearms, at least
18 the lead vehicle was, in other words how possible it was
19 going to be for them to carry out any orders? Do you
20 think on reflection it would have actually improved your
21 position?
22 A. My personal view is I actually don't think it would have
23 added anything, sir.
24 Q. I see. Have you seen the compilation in this case?
25 A. Yes, I have, sir.
170
1 Q. I really don't want to waste time showing it again. The
2 jury have seen it very recently. You will appreciate,
3 of course, there was a significant delay between in fact
4 the officers getting out of their cars and eventually
5 getting into the -- that's the firearms officers -- tube
6 station, wasn't there?
7 A. I have seen the compilation, but I actually can't
8 comment on the timings because I don't know, sir.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: In fairness to Mr Esposito,
10 Mr Mansfield, because he couldn't see it at the time,
11 it's really a question for 84, isn't it, or whoever, or
12 Silver, or whoever it was who said "CO19 are there".
13 MR MANSFIELD: Yes. May I just follow that through.
14 A. Sir.
15 Q. Certainly Trojan 84 will have to answer some questions
16 about how he was saying he was ready, and I will put to
17 you what he is saying about this in a moment. What he
18 is saying so far about all of this.
19 On the one hand you have them telling you that they
20 are not in a position, all right? Just in that glimpse
21 of time, were you ever standing at a window saying very
22 loudly, "What do you mean you are not there? Get
23 there", or words to that effect; did you ever say that?
24 A. Obviously I have read statements that somebody had said
25 that about me, that I said that to Trojan 84, but that's
171
1 actually not my recollection. I had various
2 conversations with Trojan 84, and we did have
3 conversations about where they were, what they were
4 doing, but when exactly that was I don't know.
5 Q. There is a lot, I suggest, you don't know. When, as the
6 learned Coroner put to you, it's Trojan 84 that may be
7 misinforming you, when he said, having said he wasn't
8 able, he suddenly says he is able, did you say: well,
9 exactly where are you? A moment ago you weren't able to
10 do it --
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Can't he leave it to him to make his
12 own mind up? He ought to know.
13 MR MANSFIELD: It's very important, I want to suggest to the
14 officer that where you are having to take -- can
15 I preface it in this way. A DSO in the
16 Notting Hill Carnival public order situation is on the
17 ground.
18 A. Yes, sir.
19 Q. In other words that's where the concept all begins. You
20 have somebody who has a hands-on position, intelligence
21 coming from elsewhere but also actually on the ground
22 collating everything and taking decisions about baton
23 rounds or not baton rounds or whatever; that's how it
24 started?
25 A. That was the original concept with public order.
172
1 Q. So now if you are going to have the concept of a DSO in
2 a central place away from it, it is extremely important,
3 I suggest, that you as the tac adviser are able to say
4 to her, "They are absolutely in a position to do this
5 because I have identified where they are"? Do you
6 follow?
7 A. Yes, sir. But the concept is entirely different. The
8 concept for a designated senior officer in a public
9 order is around the use of baton rounds.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Don't worry about that. It's a
11 different situation. Mr Mansfield is on about what
12 happens when the DSO is remote. What I am bothered
13 about, because it seems to me that Mr Mansfield will
14 want to deal with it, is how he is supposed to find out;
15 he can't cross-examine him over the radio.
16 MR MANSFIELD: I think he just says, "Where are you now?"
17 That's an easy question, isn't it, Officer? You
18 could have just said, "Where are you now?" and if they
19 had said to you, as I will come to in a moment, "None of
20 us are out of our cars and we're actually on the other
21 side of the lights and he's already gone in the tube
22 station", that might have given you a rather different
23 picture?
24 A. I don't know where they were in relation to the subject.
25 I was waiting for an order from the DSO to deploy CO19,
173
1 and I had an open phone line with Trojan 84 ready to
2 deploy them once that order had been given.
3 Q. Right, now, this area in this particular time capsule,
4 I want to ask you carefully about. What were the
5 options that you were presenting Commander Dick with as
6 a tactical adviser?
7 A. The options at the scene, as time reduces, once a person
8 gets off the bus in those circumstances, the options are
9 very limited. When you say what options was I giving
10 her, it's not a big discussion, it's just headline
11 words: what we can do here, the interception, because
12 that's about the only tactic that is available.
13 Q. Was it? Think about it very carefully --
14 A. Can you do a distance containment and challenge in those
15 circumstances? What does that look like? Picture that
16 outside Stockwell tube station, of a person getting off
17 a bus, officers deploying, and then at a distance
18 challenging that person.
19 Q. Did you put that to Commander Dick?
20 A. I apologise for giving a long answer again here, but
21 base that against the threat and risk that they were
22 dealing with at that time.
23 Q. Yes, we just need to know: did you tell Commander Dick
24 that. Because we have heard from her about what was
25 discussed. Did you put that to her?
174
1 A. Again I can't remember the words, exact words that
2 I used, but probably said something like CO19
3 interception or something like that, or CO19 would do
4 it, they'd stop them, an interception.
5 Q. Or did you say, "Wait and allow him on the tube", as
6 another option?
7 A. Absolutely not, sir.
8 Q. Absolutely not?
9 A. Absolutely not. A firearms option always is to say that
10 if you wait, well, it's always an option, to wait, and
11 that's one for the DSO to understand, and if you wait,
12 the result here would have been to let them on the tube.
13 Q. Did you put that option to her?
14 A. It wouldn't have been one that would come to mind, sir.
15 Q. Wouldn't it?
16 A. No.
17 Q. Are you quite sure? "Let him run"?
18 A. No, absolutely not, sir.
19 Q. All right. Use the other words, "Wait and allow him on
20 the tube"?
21 A. Absolutely not, sir.
22 Q. Look at page 60 of your statement, please. This is
23 a statement that you made, the jury don't have it but so
24 they may be reminded, a few days later, the 25th. You
25 can see it's on the front page, 25 July. Could we go to
175
1 the top of the page. There is a sentence that has
2 already been referred to:
3 "I was informed by surveillance that this was
4 a positive identification for the subject
5 Hussain Osman ..."
6 You kept a open line with Trojan 84, discussing what
7 was happening and so on:
8 "I was told the subject believed to be Hussain Osman
9 was now standing up on the deck of the bus and making
10 his way to the exit of the bus. This would take him
11 directly to Stockwell tube. I asked Commander Dick for
12 a decision because in a matter of seconds this person,
13 a potential identified suicide bomber, would be into the
14 tube [station]. I said that the options had not
15 changed, either wait and allow on the tube or intercept
16 and challenge."
17 Now, did you say that?
18 A. What I said to Commander Dick at that time was that the
19 options were to intercept and challenge; if you wait he
20 will be allowed to go on the tube.
21 Q. I asked you very particularly just before and you said
22 no, you said no only minutes ago?
23 A. To wait and allow to get on the tube was never
24 an option, it was never the intention, it was never
25 anything that was discussed. That was not my intention
176
1 because that just was never an option.
2 Q. Just look at page 59. I want to suggest to you this was
3 an option being considered by somebody such that
4 somebody else overheard it. Now, in the middle of the
5 page, 59:
6 "... Trojan 84 by phone ... kept a constant open
7 line".
8 It was after he has left at 9.34, get your bearings
9 on this page, somebody has left at 9.34, possible
10 identification for the subject Osman. As we go down the
11 page, you contact Trojan 84 by phone, kept a constant
12 open line:
13 "He was relaying his position to me and I was
14 relaying the information and intelligence. He was at
15 that time making ground to join the surveillance.
16 I dynamically discussed the options with Commander Dick,
17 which were at that time do nothing and continue to
18 follow or conduct an interception."
19 A. What that means, sir, is to wait. It is always
20 an option for either a police commander or a DSO to wait
21 to either get a more appropriate intervention position
22 or because, at that particular time, there aren't any
23 appropriate tactics to deal with that. So --
24 Q. Go back to page 60. What on earth are you doing
25 bringing it up when he is outside Stockwell tube station
177
1 as an option to her, and it is "I said" and it is your
2 words, do you follow, that sentence?
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. "I said that the options had not changed, either wait
5 and allow on the tube..."
6 What on earth are you saying that to her for?
7 A. I didn't say that to her, sir, wait and allow on the
8 tube. That wasn't my intention. If that's what's
9 written there, then it's obviously my statement but that
10 wasn't the tactical advice I gave her. The intention of
11 these, this sentence, was if you wait, you will allow
12 them on the tube. It was never discussed. It was never
13 an option.
14 Q. She would not need to be told that, would she: if you
15 wait, he might get on the tube. She wouldn't need to be
16 told that by you, would she?
17 A. That was obvious, sir.
18 Q. No. She would only need to be told that if you were
19 saying as a tactical adviser this was an option in this
20 case?
21 A. I never gave that to Commander Dick as an option. Why
22 would I want a person who I believed to be a suicide
23 terrorist to go down on the tube? It just doesn't make
24 sense.
25 Q. No, I am not allowed to make comments so I will not make
178
1 comments on that.
2 Now, in relation to this part of the operation, he's
3 got off the bus. Have you read the statements of the
4 key figures with whom you had contact that day, that is
5 particularly Trojan 84 and the firearms team below
6 Trojan 84? Have you read the statements in this case?
7 A. No I haven't, sir.
8 Q. I will put one or two things to you to see if you are
9 aware of them even if you have not read the statements.
10 The first point is this: that in relation to all the
11 cars and all the firearms officers, none of them had
12 left their vehicles before Jean Charles de Menezes
13 entered the tube station. Did you know that before
14 today?
15 A. I can't answer that, sir.
16 Q. I'm only asking you whether you knew it before today?
17 A. Yes, I did know it --
18 Q. Right. When did you first know?
19 A. During the course of the Health and Safety trial, during
20 the course of this inquiry.
21 Q. Right. That's the first point. Secondly, that the
22 decision finally to send in SO19 was only taken once
23 Jean Charles de Menezes had gone through the barriers
24 and was going down the escalator. Did you know that?
25 A. I can't say, because I don't know where the subject was.
179
1 At the time I don't know. I didn't know. Because I was
2 in the control room and things were developing down on
3 the ground.
4 Q. So we just have a synopsis. You don't know where the
5 firearms team is, except they say it's possible. You
6 don't know where the target is. You don't know that
7 they are in fact the other side of the lights, that's
8 the firearms team, and actually not in a position to
9 stop him entering the tube station. You don't know any
10 of that, do you?
11 A. The role of the firearms team and the role of the
12 firearms team leader and tactical adviser is to manage
13 it on the ground. What they needed to tell me is either
14 they are in a position or they are not, if that is the
15 decision to be taken by the DSO. Once I know that, the
16 DSO then makes a decision and the teams then deploy.
17 Q. I want to put something to you in relation to Trojan 84.
18 Did you have more contact with him than anyone else?
19 A. I was dealing with Trojan 84 and the tactical adviser
20 for Portnall Road, sir.
21 Q. Of course it comes back to the question of whether he
22 ever said he was in a position to intercept. Did he say
23 that, Trojan 84? Did he ever tell you he was in
24 a position?
25 A. My understanding of the conversation and my memory of it
180
1 was they said: we are here or we are there or words to
2 that effect which is --
3 Q. Did he say he was in a position to intercept or
4 intervene, whatever word we use, did he say that to you?
5 A. I can't remember the exact words that he used, but I am
6 sitting in the control room, I have got an open phone
7 line, I have to rely on what I am being told and then
8 I relay that to the designated senior officer who then
9 makes the decision around the deployment.
10 Q. Did he say, "We can do it"?
11 A. He says: we are here, we are there --
12 Q. I am sorry, I am going to press you on this, because I'm
13 going to suggest, on the basis of what he is saying so
14 far, that he is not saying to you he is in a position to
15 do it; he is just following orders that are suddenly
16 coming across to get on with it. Do I make myself
17 clear?
18 A. Yes, he is following orders. He is following orders
19 exactly. They will not deploy until the order is given,
20 so wherever they are at the point of the order given,
21 that's when they will deploy from.
22 Q. You know the traffic light system?
23 A. Yes, sir.
24 Q. Were you aware of any of the states having been ordered,
25 green, amber or red?
181
1 A. I know that state red was called.
2 Q. When?
3 A. I understand it was called by Ralph.
4 Q. Yes?
5 A. But I don't know when that was called. It was called
6 after the decision from the DSO for CO19 to do the
7 interception and my relaying that order to Trojan 84.
8 Q. I am going to read directly from what Trojan 84 says
9 about this important section, and it's page 335, so
10 could we have it up on the screen and perhaps before the
11 break, I'll deal with this passage. At the top of this
12 page he is dealing with the fact that at this point,
13 this is just at Stockwell Road heading towards the
14 junction with the A3:
15 "I contacted Trojan 80 and retained an open line on
16 the mobile. As we approached the junction, we were
17 behind a number 2 bus. The VRM was not our bus.
18 I could see a number 2 bus across the main Stockwell
19 tube junction. The registration number was unclear. At
20 this point I heard that the subject had got off the bus
21 and was heading towards the tube. I received the
22 instruction from Trojan 80 that they wanted the subject
23 intercepted."
24 Pause there. You agree that much; yes?
25 A. Yes, sir.
182
1 Q. "I put this over the radio. I also heard the DCI SO19
2 officer say that they wanted us to intercept the
3 subject."
4 Is that the Silver?
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's Mr Purser.
6 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
7 Is that right?
8 A. That's what's written there, sir, yes.
9 Q. He is saying the same:
10 "I then heard Trojan 80 say that the subject must
11 not be allowed to get on the tube."
12 Did you say that?
13 A. I relayed the words that were said to me from -- it
14 sounds like something I said. I was relaying the
15 directions of the DSO at that stage.
16 Q. Yes, these words are very important. I want to put to
17 you why I suggest they are important, is that firearms
18 officers understood because he must not be allowed to
19 get on the tube, that you had intelligence that he in
20 fact had a bomb, he was an immediate threat?
21 A. That's not the case, sir.
22 Q. No, I know it isn't. We will just go on:
23 "I then put over the radio that they want us to stop
24 the subject getting on the tube. I put this instruction
25 over the radio and confirmed that Ralph had heard me.
183
1 I heard Ralph say state red over the radio ..."
2 Do you see that?
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. That's actually how it went, isn't it?
5 A. That's Trojan 84's statement, again I can't comment on
6 that, sir.
7 Q. Because it involves you directly: is that how you
8 remember it?
9 A. I remember the order: stop him, stop him going down the
10 tube, stop him, he must not be allowed to get on the
11 tube; that's actually not my recollection of the wording
12 in exact words, but it was around about.
13 MR MANSFIELD: Sir, I see the time.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I was going to say, is that
15 a convenient moment?
16 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, it is.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I have one simple question and I think
18 you know the answer.
19 Calls into the control room, radio traffic, at the
20 time anyway, were not being recorded, were they?
21 A. No, sir.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I thought not. Thank you. Twenty to.
23 (3.32 pm)
24 (A short break)
25
184
1 (3.43 pm)
2 (In the presence of the jury)
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Mr Mansfield, you have had an hour and
4 a half, how are you getting on?
5 MR MANSFIELD: I have kept to all the time estimates so far.
6 I think I am going to overrun this one as it's only 15
7 minutes to go. I am endeavouring to do it as quickly as
8 possible but you will see he is a key figure.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I appreciate that, but I am very
10 anxious, I really am.
11 MR MANSFIELD: I appreciate that. I apologise to the jury
12 if we sit a bit late and have to sit a bit early
13 tomorrow.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It did seem to me that quite a lot of
15 stuff earlier this afternoon was not being wholly
16 productive.
17 MR MANSFIELD: It's a matter for the jury, obviously.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, indeed.
19 MR MANSFIELD: I am just dealing with what was actually said
20 between you and Trojan 84, and I have dealt with what he
21 says in his statement.
22 Can I just finish this off by asking for 362, this
23 is the statement of the team leader Ralph, as to what he
24 did at this particular juncture. Towards the bottom
25 there is a sentence:
185
1 "We followed the bus to the area of Stockwell Road
2 near the Underground station during which I had
3 confirmation over the radio that the suspect was
4 definitely our man. He was nervous and twitchy. The
5 number 2 bus came to a stop outside the National
6 Westminster bank and the NatWest corner of the junction
7 with Clapham Road, Stockwell Road and left on foot,
8 walked back towards the Underground station, entrance in
9 Clapham Road, and entered."
10 So you will see from there he is still in the car
11 listening:
12 "Trojan 84 came on the radio and said, 'He's to be
13 stopped getting on the tube'. I asked for confirmation
14 and it was repeated by Trojan 84. I then went on to the
15 main working channel and informed everyone that we were
16 now at 'state red, state red' which indicates that SO19
17 have taken control of the operation and that an armed
18 intervention was imminent."
19 You see all that.
20 A. Sir.
21 Q. So the suggestion I'm making to you clearly before the
22 break is that what has happened here is that very late
23 in the day, the firearms team are told to do it. They
24 are not asked: are you in a position; they are told to
25 do it. They go to state red when he has already gone
186
1 into the tube station; do you see that?
2 A. Sir.
3 Q. Is that what happened?
4 A. This is the team leader's statement. It reflects what
5 Trojan 84 was saying to him, which reflects what I was
6 saying to Trojan 84. Where anybody was in that
7 continuum, again, I don't know. I am waiting for the
8 order from the DSO, and the order was given for them to
9 stop him getting on the tube, to stop him going down.
10 I relayed that order to Trojan 84. But where they were
11 again, I can't say.
12 Q. I appreciate that. You see, I am going to suggest that
13 what happened here was that that firearms officer,
14 page 363, as a result of how it was being handled in the
15 control room, was left in no doubt -- it's at the top of
16 the page -- that this man was a suicide bomber and
17 a real possibility that he was in possession of
18 an explosive device. Do you see all that?
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 Q. Right.
21 A. That takes the background and the threat and risk of
22 what we were dealing with at that time. If that officer
23 formed that opinion, then that officer can tell us about
24 it, but we were dealing with a potential suicide bomber,
25 we were dealing with suicide bombers who had failed the
187
1 day before, so I would suggest that that is, will be in
2 his mind that we were dealing with a suicide bomber.
3 Q. The care that has to be taken in this situation,
4 difficult though it is, is that just because somebody
5 was a suicide or may have been a suicide bomber the day
6 before doesn't entitle anyone to shoot him, does it?
7 A. No, the officers that deploy will assess the threat and
8 risk at that point.
9 Q. Right, I just want to ask you this: how does someone
10 discern if there is -- can I go through this. He was
11 not carrying a rucksack, was he?
12 A. Not to my knowledge, sir, no.
13 Q. He wasn't carrying any kind of bag, was he?
14 A. Not to my knowledge, no, sir.
15 Q. He wasn't seen to be constantly referring to his hand
16 other than with a mobile phone when he got off the bus,
17 wasn't seen to be carrying anything else, was he?
18 A. I can't answer that, sir, because I am sitting in the
19 control room. All the information I have is what's
20 coming over the surveillance.
21 Q. What are officers trained to look for where there is no
22 bag, no toggle, nothing in the hand? What are they
23 trained to look for in order to assess that this is not
24 only the suicide bomber from the day before, but
25 somebody who's posing an invisible threat because you
188
1 can't see it on that day?
2 A. The threat that was faced at the time, each individual
3 officer will have to answer that themselves.
4 Q. What are they trained to look for?
5 A. There are a number of things that officers are trained
6 to look for in any firearms operation: how the person is
7 behaving, what they are doing, what the threat is faced
8 at that time, and they will respond to that. There
9 isn't any list, there isn't any issues, there is
10 a number of headline things that have been evolved from
11 studies around the world, but each individual officer
12 will have to assess the situation as they see it at that
13 time.
14 Q. Yes, I appreciate that, and that -- I am sorry, it may
15 have taken longer this afternoon because your answers
16 are constantly very long ones. The question I have said
17 for the second, third time: what are the sort of things
18 that the officer who can't see a rucksack, can't see a
19 toggle, can't see anything in the hand, how is he going
20 to say this is a suicide bomber today?
21 A. I can't answer that. Only the officer can answer that.
22 Q. I will leave it then. You can't answer that.
23 I just want to deal with the question of
24 non-compliance. How does this come into it at all as
25 you have put it in your policy log?
189
1 A. In exactly the same way as a normal plain firearms
2 operation, if a person -- if the firearms officer is
3 facing a threat of a suicide terrorist, and that person
4 fails to comply with what the officer does and that
5 officer perceives an imminent immediate risk to their
6 life and the lives of the public, then the officer will
7 take an action which is proportionate to that threat; in
8 other words they may take the decision to fire their
9 weapon.
10 Q. I follow that. What is it that officer is going to use
11 as a threshold for a critical shot at very close
12 quarters nine times, what is going to trigger that? Do
13 you follow?
14 A. Again, I can't answer that, sir. I can't answer what
15 an individual officer's threshold is for when they may
16 or may not fire a weapon. Only the individual officer
17 can answer that threshold question.
18 Q. I see, so you can't answer that one either?
19 A. No.
20 Q. Were you expecting that in fact this covert operation
21 would entail officers rushing on to a tube carriage and
22 shouting, "Armed police", with the real risk they would
23 all get blown up if he was who you thought he was?
24 A. At the start of the day anything is possible, sir. We
25 don't know how it's going to unfold.
190
1 Q. No, I appreciate, but they are running down the
2 escalator, we know that, to catch up; are they being
3 trained that if they are going to, in an enclosed
4 environment, tackle a suicide bomber who they are
5 convinced is a suicide bomber, are they going to shout
6 "Armed police"?
7 A. I have said earlier, and I hate to keep repeating
8 myself, but only the officer at that point can decide
9 whether or not they issue a challenge, whether or not
10 they decide to fire their weapon. Only that officer at
11 that point can do it.
12 Q. What amounts to non-compliance, then, since you
13 discussed it in the log? You see it's on page 7 of your
14 policy log:
15 "Contingency for non-compliance has been discussed".
16 So what has been discussed as being non-compliant?
17 A. Each set of circumstances will depend on what the
18 officer is faced with at that time. This is an issue
19 that is discussed with the DSOs, is discussed with
20 police commanders, so that they are aware that even
21 though we are dealing with a normal firearms operation,
22 because of the threat and the risk that is faced, it may
23 well end up to be a police shooting because of the
24 threat and risk that is faced.
25 But only the officer can say what they consider to
191
1 be non-compliance at that time.
2 Q. Does it amount to this: that there is hardly any room
3 for manoeuvre and once the man is identified, he is
4 dead?
5 A. Absolutely not, sir.
6 Q. Then what is the room for manoeuvre that is discussed?
7 A. The room is what the officers perceive at that time,
8 because they are facing the threat, they have been
9 briefed on the risk, they have been briefed on the
10 threat; and when they face it, they will make the
11 individual decision based on what they see.
12 Q. I will end on this, but are they taught: well, tell him
13 to stop, and if he doesn't, he gets shot; tell him to
14 stop what he is doing, give some instruction so we know
15 whether he is not complying; or is it just go up to him
16 and if he doesn't look as though he is complying, we
17 shoot him? Do you follow why I am anxious to determine
18 what the threshold is?
19 A. Yes, I do, but there isn't a threshold.
20 Q. There isn't?
21 A. There isn't a threshold. It's the individual officer's
22 decision.
23 Q. So it's really almost a matter of chance as to whether
24 someone lives or dies?
25 A. It's not a matter of chance at all. It's the officers
192
1 are highly trained, the officers will face the threat,
2 the officers will respond in a proportionate way to that
3 threat.
4 Q. I have already dealt with what actually occurred in
5 terms of the number of shots. I want to go back in
6 time, if I may, to a situation right at the beginning
7 where I suggest none of this need have happened if this
8 had been a properly planned operation; do you follow?
9 A. Sir, yes.
10 Q. Now, when you come on -- you can use the log or the jury
11 can use either Mr Callum's log -- use your policy log to
12 begin with, starting at, and I am not going through all
13 the entries again. I just want to pick up various
14 points.
15 You are on at 6 o'clock, we can see that on page 5.
16 First of all, on the 6 o'clock entry, it's perfectly
17 clear that you were unaware of what Mr McDowall's
18 overnight strategy was; is that right?
19 A. No, I was aware of the strategy, sir.
20 Q. Where is it noted that you were aware of what
21 Mr McDowall had set as the strategy overnight?
22 A. Sorry, at that time I was handing over from Andrew, and
23 at that time we were discussing resources, and at that
24 time we were supporting an operation.
25 Q. What operation?
193
1 A. There were developing intelligence around addresses, we
2 had one central team at Scotland Yard, and that team was
3 there to respond to any developing intelligence around
4 Operation Theseus.
5 Q. That's what you thought. Did you know what McDowall's
6 strategy was at 4.55?
7 A. It was to control addresses. It was to deploy firearms
8 teams to the addresses as soon as it was practical to do
9 so.
10 Q. Right, so you did know that. You knew that McDowall at
11 5 to 5 had mentioned addresses. Now, where did you get
12 that from?
13 A. I said earlier, I don't know where I got that
14 information from, but I knew, when I came on duty I knew
15 when I handed over that there was an address at
16 Scotia Road and there was a developing intelligence
17 around other addresses, at the 6.48 meeting or the
18 meeting at the time --
19 Q. I am going to stop you there, otherwise I won't finish
20 by 5 o'clock. We will come to the 7 o'clock meeting.
21 At 6 o'clock you knew that McDowall had set a strategy
22 which involved containing and challenging and so on?
23 A. My understanding of the strategy at that time was the
24 intelligence-gathering operation to control addresses as
25 a start time for this operation, as a start for this
194
1 operation.
2 Q. Did you know that in fact he had said as soon as
3 possible and in fact an officer in a control position in
4 the operations room had asked for the orange team to go
5 to Scotia Road as soon as possible; did you know that?
6 A. I know it now, sir, but at that time I was never asked
7 to deploy any teams out to Scotia Road, and it wasn't my
8 understanding that any teams would be deployed out there
9 at that time.
10 Q. I see. Where did you get that understanding from?
11 A. Well, we had one team --
12 Q. Where did you get the understanding from?
13 A. Because there hadn't been any deployments.
14 Q. Right, so you knew at 6 o'clock that there hadn't been
15 a deployment, but you didn't know that one had been
16 asked for; you have only learnt that later; correct?
17 A. Sir.
18 Q. Did you ask, as the senior tactical adviser: well, why
19 hasn't the orange team been sent out?
20 A. No, because I didn't -- I didn't know that there was any
21 expectations that any firearms teams would be sent out
22 to any of these addresses.
23 Q. Very well. Were you aware that a DSO had been
24 identified for the orange team overnight?
25 A. A DSO had been identified for the operation overnight.
195
1 Q. Yes, I don't mean the 24-hour one, but a specific DSO to
2 take charge of the orange team should they be deployed.
3 Did you know that?
4 A. A DSO had been appointed for Operation Theseus to come
5 on at 7 o'clock in the morning.
6 Q. No, no, no, overnight. I will put the DSO name just to
7 speed it up: Andrew Baker?
8 A. I don't know, sir.
9 Q. You don't know, right.
10 A. My understanding was that the overnight DSO was
11 Commander Carter.
12 Q. Yes, he does the 24-hour job, I am dealing with the
13 specific possibility of a team going out. All right?
14 Andrew Baker, DSO identified, Silvers have been
15 identified if not spoken to as possible Silvers on
16 deployment; did you know that?
17 A. I don't think Mr Baker was a DSO overnight, sir.
18 Q. All right, that's what we have been told. So you don't
19 think he was a DSO, I am not suggesting he was sitting
20 in New Scotland Yard, but he had been identified?
21 A. My understanding was that it was Commander Carter was
22 the overnight DSO.
23 Q. He is for the 24-hour response. All right? Kratos
24 response in the room below, on the floor below. Do you
25 follow?
196
1 A. I don't know of any DSO appointed before Commander Dick
2 for the Theseus operation and Commander Carter for the
3 24-hour operation.
4 Q. Right. So I'll just move it on. So at 6 o'clock, you
5 know that in fact nobody's actually been deployed, you
6 don't know of any earlier decision that they should be
7 deployed and then we get to the 7 o'clock meeting?
8 A. Again at the risk of giving a long answer, it wouldn't
9 make sense to me to deploy a team out to Scotia Road
10 when there is a number of operations developing at that
11 time. There was, as I found out later and I knew this
12 intelligence was developing, there was a number of
13 addresses --
14 Q. Did you take that decision not to deploy because there
15 are a number of addresses?
16 A. No.
17 Q. Right. Did anyone else take that decision?
18 A. That's not my decision --
19 Q. Did anyone else take that decision?
20 A. I don't know, sir.
21 Q. Thank you. Now, if you would just kindly answer the
22 questions, we can get through it. So you don't take the
23 decision, you don't know anyone else took the decision,
24 now we are at 7 o'clock.
25 A. Sir.
197
1 Q. At 7 o'clock, there are two addresses that are being
2 prioritised?
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. There are two teams to go to the two addresses?
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 Q. One team's going to take a little bit longer than the
7 other; correct?
8 A. One team's at Scotland Yard, one team's at Leman Street,
9 yes, sir.
10 Q. One is kitted up and the other isn't?
11 A. Yes, sir.
12 Q. Was any discussion about -- well, I had better put this
13 to you: did you know that there was a surveillance team
14 already in place at Scotia Road but not at
15 Portnall Road?
16 A. I knew there was a surveillance team at Scotia Road.
17 I wasn't sure at Portnall Road at that time.
18 Q. Well, you didn't know that there was one at
19 Portnall Road, so you were aware that there had been
20 within the time from the strategy decision at 4.55 some
21 prioritisation because a red team were down at
22 Scotia Road; you knew that?
23 A. I was at that meeting with Commander McDowall, the SIO,
24 and no addresses were prioritised to me, sir.
25 Q. Was there any discussion at the 7 o'clock meeting,
198
1 "Look, we have got a red team down there without any
2 support"?
3 A. These are not my decisions to make, sir. These are
4 decisions --
5 Q. Please answer the question, was there any discussion?
6 A. Not to my knowledge, sir.
7 Q. Thank you. Do you have problems about listening to the
8 question?
9 A. Absolutely none, sir.
10 Q. Then it will just be much quicker and I'm going to, I am
11 afraid, intervene in order to get it done. There was no
12 discussion about getting someone down to cover the red
13 team. Now, just moving on from that. At that time, did
14 you, as the tac adviser, make any suggestion about
15 getting a firearms team down to Scotia Road as soon as
16 possible?
17 A. No, sir.
18 Q. Why not?
19 A. Because I had two teams at that time, one team coming on
20 at 7 o'clock and one team at Scotland Yard. Neither
21 addresses were prioritised, so one team was allocated to
22 go to Scotia Road, one team was allocated to go to
23 Portnall Road.
24 Q. Well, I suggest to you it had already been prioritised,
25 the red team were at Scotia Road and were worried about
199
1 the fact that they didn't have firearms cover; did you
2 know that?
3 A. No. That's a question that only either the SIO or the
4 DSO can answer. I am their tactical adviser, sir.
5 I don't make decisions of that nature. I don't
6 prioritise addresses.
7 Q. Right. It must have occurred to you as a tactical
8 adviser that if in fact it's going to be the black team
9 going to Scotia Road, they are not going to get there
10 for quite a while?
11 A. No, that's right, sir.
12 Q. Yes; how long, roughly?
13 A. Couple of hours.
14 Q. Couple of hours, so it must have occurred to you that if
15 someone comes out of Scotia Road where there has been
16 a red team since 6 o'clock, which is an extra hour,
17 that's a whole three-hour period, there is no firearms
18 cover?
19 A. The decisions around --
20 Q. Sorry, did that occur to you?
21 A. Yes, it did, but --
22 Q. Right. What did you do about it?
23 A. I have to expand on it, because again, these aren't my
24 decisions to make. I'm at a meeting with --
25 Q. Sorry, I am going to interrupt. I didn't suggest it was
200
1 your decision. I asked you whether it occurred to you
2 that there was no firearms back-up for a period of three
3 hours?
4 A. If surveillance are down there, there is no firearms
5 back-up from the SFO. However, there are other measures
6 that are in place.
7 Q. Are they? Right, I want to examine what other measures
8 are in place for Scotia Road between 6 o'clock and
9 9 o'clock, which is two hours you estimated from 7,
10 roughly speaking. What are the other measures that are
11 in place should someone come out of Scotia Road?
12 A. The first resources that are available are --
13 Q. What measures were in place?
14 A. 24-hour DSO from downstairs with armed response vehicles
15 and the tactical adviser downstairs. There is the
16 surveillance team -- there are the firearms teams who
17 are briefing who make contact with the surveillance
18 officers. All these things are in place. All these
19 things can be sent out.
20 Q. Just can I deal with that first of all? Armed response
21 vehicles. Was there any provision to have two ARVs on
22 standby for Scotia Road in case somebody came out?
23 A. No, sir.
24 Q. Why not?
25 A. Because this was a covert operation. I know that the
201
1 armed response vehicles are patrolling 24 hours a day,
2 and there is a number of them in South London. Some
3 actually particularly deployed to Lambeth, which is in
4 this area. They had had a briefing the day before.
5 They are aware of the failed bombings --
6 Q. Were they aware of Scotia Road?
7 A. No, sir, and I wouldn't have informed them about
8 Scotia Road.
9 Q. And it would take an armed response vehicle, even if one
10 had been called up and was available, more than five
11 minutes to get there, wouldn't it?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Thank you.
14 A. Well, it depends where they were, sir.
15 Q. Of course, but you are not wanting an armed response
16 vehicle in the area to compromise it, so assuming it's
17 more than five minutes, that will do for the moment, but
18 there is no standby for them; were the TST who came on
19 at 7, were they on standby?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. To go to Scotia Road?
22 A. No, sir, they are on standby for the 24-hour response.
23 Q. So they are going to take more than five minutes to get
24 there?
25 A. Yes, sir.
202
1 Q. Thank you. What else do we have in place that's going
2 to take less than five minutes to get there?
3 A. They are the armed resources that are available 24 hours
4 a day.
5 Q. Please listen to the question. What else is in place
6 that will take less than five minutes to get there?
7 A. The only other response is the SO12 surveillance
8 officers themselves.
9 Q. Right. Were you aware that that is precisely what
10 Derek, in charge of the SO12 officers outside
11 Scotia Road, was wondering whether he would have to do?
12 Did you know that?
13 A. It is a possibility. At that time I didn't know, I now
14 know.
15 Q. I suggest all this came about because after 7 o'clock,
16 never mind before 7, after 7 I want to ask you this
17 carefully, please listen to the question. Did you sit
18 down with Cressida Dick and discuss what was possible at
19 Scotia Road?
20 A. I had conversations with the DSO, Commander Dick, in
21 relation to the mobile armed support to surveillance,
22 what firearms resources were available, and the tactics
23 that would develop through the day.
24 Q. I will ask the question again: did you sit down with
25 Cressida Dick and work out with her what was tactically
203
1 possible at Scotia Road.
2 A. Not in exact detail, no.
3 Q. No, in any detail?
4 A. No, because what we were supplying there --
5 Q. In any detail? In any detail?
6 A. Not specifically in relation to Scotia Road because we
7 weren't being asked to provide anything at that time.
8 There was no expectation at that time, sir.
9 Q. Oh, Mr Esposito, please think. Are you really saying --
10 think about this -- that there was no expectation after
11 7 o'clock for there to be armed support accessible in
12 case someone came out of that block?
13 A. The firearms teams had to be briefed. There has to be
14 a start point at somewhere in the operation. Whilst
15 that start point is being put in place, it's
16 a contingency and there always are contingencies, and
17 it's a very usual occurrence that whilst the teams are
18 briefing, whilst the teams are getting prepared, before
19 they can go out, in that interim period then that
20 response is provided by ARVs, it's provided by TSTs if
21 they are available and it's provided by the armed
22 surveillance officers themselves.
23 Q. I want to suggest to you that is literally off the map,
24 it couldn't have happened and that's where it all went
25 wrong. There was nobody there to intervene at an early
204
1 stage. Would you look at page 7 of the maps diagram
2 brochure, please. (Pause)
3 Could we also bear in mind your policy log. Your
4 policy log does not record any strategy of any kind,
5 does it?
6 A. In --
7 Q. In relation to Scotia Road, never mind Portnall.
8 A. Not at that time. It does later on.
9 Q. Yes. Before 9.34 your policy log does not reveal that
10 there is any strategy for Scotia Road so far as you are
11 concerned?
12 A. Tactics?
13 Q. Strategy.
14 A. The strategy for Scotia Road was --
15 Q. No, please understand. The question was: your policy
16 log does not reveal any record of the strategy?
17 A. I have not made notes of the strategy set by Mr McDowall
18 in this log.
19 Q. No, we move on, you haven't got it for McDowall; where
20 is the strategy set out in the log by Commander Dick in
21 relation to Scotia Road?
22 A. I haven't recorded that. That was verbal conversations
23 between myself and Commander Dick.
24 Q. I have no doubt it was. She didn't do it through
25 thought transference. She obviously spoke to you. Why
205
1 is it not written up in your policy log?
2 A. Because I didn't see the need for it at that time,
3 because what we were provided here was support to
4 surveillance, and then whatever happened at that
5 address, that I would be speaking to Commander Dick in
6 relation to tactical options to stop or intervene
7 a subject.
8 Q. You discussed that with her, did you? Did you? Did you
9 discuss --
10 A. I talked about options in relation to Scotia Road;
11 I talked about options in relation to where subjects
12 might be going; I talked about options for both this and
13 the other addresses.
14 Q. Right, this one I am going to concentrate on to save
15 time. Did you discuss the tactic that was necessary to
16 prevent a subject, possible or identified, getting on
17 a bus?
18 A. No, I didn't.
19 Q. You didn't. Why not?
20 A. Two things. First of all, the subject has to be
21 identified, he has to be followed, and then the officers
22 have to be in a position to intercept, so whatever
23 happens, the plan that was put in place to control the
24 premises with surveillance, to have firearms officers
25 supporting them from a covert location, was to me
206
1 appropriate for this location.
2 Q. Did you say to Commander Dick: this is an impossible
3 situation, we can't stop anybody getting on a bus?
4 A. No, I didn't.
5 Q. Right. So did you discuss with Commander Dick, either
6 with a map like this or whatever's available in New
7 Scotland Yard, that it will be a matter for the
8 particular team, the black team, to work out exactly
9 where they are going to do the stop, but the one thing
10 we must do is ensure that they understand they have to
11 be in a position covertly to stop the person getting on
12 a bus?
13 A. No. No, I never said that.
14 Q. No, I know. My suggestion is that that is precisely the
15 core of the matter, because of what had happened the day
16 before. Is it not the core of the matter?
17 A. Not to me, sir, no.
18 Q. I see. You really weren't concerned about the
19 possibility that somebody might get on a bus?
20 A. We have to deal with the practicalities of this, and
21 again I am going to be accused of giving a long answer,
22 but the tactics available within this location are
23 limited because of the threat that you are dealing with,
24 and because of the risk that you are dealing with.
25 Q. Are they more limited than dealing with it on a bus or
207
1 in a tube train?
2 A. There are equal challenges for both.
3 Q. Well, I would like to know, you see, the extent to which
4 all of this was discussed with Dick in the two hours or
5 the one hour -- we will restrict it to that. She is
6 appointed as DSO during the 8 o'clock meeting; did you
7 know that? She was appointed as DSO in the 8 o'clock
8 meeting?
9 A. I don't know when she was appointed.
10 Q. You don't know when she was appointed?
11 A. I know that she was --
12 Q. She was asked to be the DSO but in fact her role was
13 mapped out in the 8 o'clock meeting?
14 A. My understanding was that when I attended the meetings
15 at, which is shown in the log, that she was the DSO.
16 Q. In whatever hour was available there, and I suggest
17 certainly 8 to 9, did you sit down and say: well, there
18 is a challenge here but we can do it and this is how we
19 can do it, and I will make sure Trojan 84 knows that we
20 need to stop somebody before they get on a bus?
21 A. No.
22 Q. Did you even know where the bus stops were?
23 A. I knew there were bus stops there, it depends on what
24 time in the morning. I was aware --
25 Q. Before he comes out at 9.34, there have already been
208
1 five people out?
2 A. I was aware that there were bus stops there, yes.
3 Q. Where?
4 A. I knew that there was one in Tulse Hill, and I knew
5 there were other bus stops about because of the
6 discussions that had been going on before that, but
7 exactly where, I don't know, sir.
8 Q. We have been over the point before. Were you aware on
9 the question of buses that actually the surveillance
10 monitor and one other had already been on to the bus
11 company and they thought that they had got them stopped?
12 Did you know that?
13 A. I had absolutely no idea of that, sir, no.
14 Q. If there was a decision by Commander Dick that any
15 stopping of the buses might compromise the operation,
16 this is rather serious if somebody in the operations
17 room is doing completely the opposite, isn't it?
18 A. I can't answer questions on what other people would or
19 wouldn't do.
20 Q. Can you explain how the loggist who comes on -- and you
21 have already seen it, I don't ask it to come up -- has
22 indicated that the buses were suspended?
23 A. I can't explain that, sir.
24 Q. Can you explain how the loggist in fact never comes up
25 with a positive identification, as opposed to what you
209
1 are saying; your loggist?
2 A. My recollection, and my thoughts on that, that it was
3 a positive identification.
4 Q. I mean, when you read the log, and you see that the bus,
5 according to that log, was suspended and there is no
6 positive identification, did that cause you to question
7 your own recollection of events?
8 A. No. My recollection of events are as I remember them,
9 sir.
10 Q. All right. Just dealing with this plan of the area, you
11 are not saying, are you, that it would have been -- had
12 you got people there in time -- not possible to do
13 a proper controlled stop before anyone got to the bus if
14 they were possible identical with?
15 A. In relation to this whole location, again I am going to
16 give a long answer, sir, and I do apologise, but
17 whatever tactic that we deploy has to be based against
18 the threat and risk that exists at that time. Now, at
19 this location, because it has the space, the option that
20 would likely be chosen, whether it be a distance
21 containment and challenge, or an intervention by SFO
22 officers, would be extremely loud, extremely noisy,
23 extremely impactive on this whole area.
24 Think of that if you are a terrorist within that
25 block of Scotia Road, which we believed --
210
1 Q. Are you saying it would have been impossible to do
2 a stop in this area?
3 A. No, of course we could have done it, sir, but it would
4 have been -- what would be the results of taking action
5 at that time, and the result of taking action at that
6 time would be highly likely to be a compromise of the
7 operation.
8 Q. If you didn't take action and it was a suicide bomber or
9 a possible suicide bomber, you were prepared to run that
10 risk, were you?
11 A. That's not my decision to make, sir. I advise on the
12 tactics. The DSO decides what tactic they want in what
13 circumstances and when.
14 Q. Could we have, please -- the jury have it as a decision
15 log in their own bundle, of Commander Dick and it's
16 decision 3, please.
17 Her decision log, decision 3. Tab 48 in the jury's
18 bundle. I just want to ask you whether you were aware,
19 because it's not in your policy log, this is her policy,
20 as it were, set out in her decision log written up later
21 at 11 o'clock on the 22nd:
22 "Strategy I have agreed ... we seek to arrest any of
23 the subjects near or at the addresses."
24 Did you know that?
25 A. I didn't know that at the time. My understanding of it,
211
1 it was just arrest the subjects. I didn't know at that
2 time it was near or at the address.
3 Q. So when did you first discover that that's what she was
4 wanting to achieve?
5 A. I am not sure if that exactly is what she was wanting to
6 achieve.
7 Q. Well, she has told us what she was intending to achieve.
8 May I just describe it to you since you don't appear to
9 know. Firstly, she didn't want to compromise the
10 operation by doing it so close to the address that
11 somebody would spot it, but she didn't want to do it so
12 far away that there was any prospect of somebody
13 obviously risking the public safety, in particular
14 obviously by getting on buses and trains. All right?
15 A. Yes, sir.
16 Q. If you just cast your eye down, you will see the second
17 paragraph under the reasons:
18 "We can not therefore allow them to travel far even
19 under surveillance if sighted ..."
20 Do you see that?
21 A. Yes, sir.
22 Q. Did you know that? Did you know she had decided that?
23 A. I have since read that, but at that time I didn't know
24 that's what she had written.
25 Q. You see, how are you going to give her advice if you
212
1 don't know what she's decided?
2 A. Because she asks me for advice, and I'm by her side all
3 the time, and whatever she asks me is the options and
4 the advice that I give her, based on the circumstances
5 that exist at that time.
6 Q. So does it come to this: that as far as this plan 7 and
7 the area is concerned, she never in fact asked you for
8 advice about how to stop somebody, or whether it would
9 be possible to stop somebody getting on to a bus?
10 A. I can't remember the decision -- I can't remember the
11 exact conversations about whether or not it would be
12 impossible to stop somebody getting on a bus. I can
13 remember conversations about doing interceptions at this
14 location. But the exact details of them, again ...
15 Q. You see, what is supposed to happen is that you have
16 done your generic tac document, and what you are
17 supposed to do, even if you don't do it at the time, is
18 write up at some point a list of the options that you
19 have presented to the DSO so that it can be seen what
20 she has been offered, as it were, and what she may have
21 rejected. That's very common practice, isn't it?
22 A. It's common practice for a static operation, and the
23 advice that goes on before an operation. But when
24 an operation is underway, when an operation is dynamic,
25 you just don't have the time to do that because of all
213
1 the things that have to be done. That's why there is
2 the verbal conversations between myself and the DSO in
3 relation to what's achievable and what we want to do.
4 Q. Yes, I appreciate, you can't do it at the time. You
5 just do it later on that night when you in fact come to
6 write up your recollections, as you have put it, at the
7 end of the policy log this particular day? That's when
8 you do it, isn't it?
9 A. No.
10 Q. I see.
11 A. You don't.
12 Q. You appreciate now, possibly not then, that getting from
13 Scotia Road to one of the nearest bus stops, well,
14 perhaps you didn't know how long it would take, did you?
15 A. I had maps there, I knew it could only take a minute,
16 but that's -- at that time, again I have to reiterate,
17 that the first person has to be identified, then the
18 decision has to be made by the designated senior
19 officer.
20 Q. Yes?
21 A. Then as a result of that decision, action will be taken
22 and I dynamically discuss options with her.
23 Q. Yes, I have been through all of that and what has not
24 been discussed. In order, therefore, in that timeframe
25 to get a firearms team or firearms intervention into
214
1 place, they have to be within -- as they were at
2 Portnall Road -- a couple of minutes, don't they?
3 A. They have to be in a position, yes.
4 Q. Thank you. Now, I want to ask you this, finally, in
5 relation to how it would differ if SO12 did it, do you
6 follow, that you were saying earlier on it would have
7 been quite different. What's different about an SO12
8 intervention as opposed it a CO19 intervention?
9 A. SO12 aren't trained for interventions. The only
10 intervention-trained officers are CO19 specialist
11 firearms officers.
12 Q. All right. Intervention in the sense of putting
13 themselves between the threat and the public, whether
14 it's intervention or interception, only SO19 can do
15 that?
16 A. At Scotia Road, if SO12 had been deployed, it would have
17 been a distance containment and challenge.
18 Q. Right. Just so the jury know, what would be, when SO12
19 do it at Scotia Road, involved in them doing it, when
20 you say distance containment and challenge?
21 A. Without going into too much tactical detail, it's just
22 something that's extremely noisy, that they would put
23 themselves at a distance from the potential subject, and
24 deploy and try and contain that subject at a distance.
25 Q. Right. On the assumption, of course, some of them are
215
1 static and can't do that, obviously the better thing at
2 Scotia Road is to have firearms officers do it because
3 they are in back-up vehicles and so on?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. That's obvious. I want to move back to Stockwell
6 itself. We have seen the compilation video. If SO12
7 had not been countermanded -- and of course you didn't
8 hear the decision, so you have said, that they should be
9 sent in to do it -- if they had actually done it, what
10 would have been how they would have done it? Can you
11 help us?
12 A. Probably in the same way, that they would have assessed
13 the threat, drawn their weapons, and challenged that
14 person at a distance.
15 Q. You see, one of the situations the jury have seen is
16 that Jean Charles de Menezes goes into the tube station,
17 picks up a Metro, goes through the barriers, down the
18 escalator, and you have seen as well that the
19 surveillance officers, the first few, are very close by,
20 aren't they?
21 A. Yes, I have seen the video, sir.
22 Q. If in that situation, since he has gone through the
23 barriers, SO12 had done a surprise challenge, in other
24 words they had come up behind and obviously an officer
25 from in front as well, that would have achieved first of
216
1 all an element of surprise, wouldn't it?
2 A. That's not their tactics and it's not their training,
3 sir. That's not what they would have done.
4 Q. Okay, well, just tell us what they would have done
5 insofar as their training?
6 A. They would have stood off and they would have challenged
7 the person.
8 Q. Well, on the escalator or down at the bottom?
9 A. Wherever, in exactly the same way as the SFO officers at
10 the point that they deployed, they would deploy
11 according to their training and that is their training.
12 Q. I want to suggest to you, if the SO12 officers, of which
13 there were three on the escalator at one point, had in
14 fact done a surprise challenge at that point --
15 A. That they wouldn't have done a surprise challenge, sir,
16 because that is not their training, that is
17 an intervention and they are not trained to do that.
18 Q. What is the difference, can you just explain, between
19 what they are trained to do and an intervention?
20 A. I explained intervention and interception before. That
21 the level of --
22 Q. I just want the difference between the two so we can
23 weigh up --
24 A. A specialist firearms officer will be able to deploy
25 covertly close to that subject. They will be able to
217
1 put themselves in that position close so that they are
2 between the threat and the public, whereas opposed to
3 an SO12 officer who would have to stand off and
4 challenge that subject.
5 Q. When we are talking about distances and stand off for
6 SO12, what are we talking about?
7 A. Only the officer can assess that at that time.
8 Q. When the officer who is assessing it at the time says he
9 is in a position to do it, as they did, they offered to
10 do this stop, first of all, did you know they had
11 offered?
12 A. Yes, I did.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, he said so.
14 MR MANSFIELD: So you knew they had offered. They had made
15 an assessment that they could do it?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Right, and in retrospect, had they done it, because we
18 now know the firearms officers were on the other side of
19 the road, had they done it, in a situation not on a tube
20 train, the result, I suggest, would have been very
21 different, wouldn't it?
22 A. That's hindsight, sir. At the time I made that
23 decision, I am thinking about what the threat is. I'm
24 thinking about the skills of the SFO officers, I am
25 thinking about the skills of the SO12 officers. All the
218
1 issues that that person they are dealing with, that
2 person they are going to stop, is believed to be
3 a suicide terrorist, what is the best resource to do
4 that, and for me at that time it was CO19.
5 Q. Yes. In hindsight, we will do it in hindsight on this
6 one. Now you know where the firearms officers actually
7 were, it would have been better to let the SO12 officers
8 do it, wouldn't it?
9 A. No, sir.
10 MR MANSFIELD: Thank you, I have no further questions.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Can I dispose of one or two questions.
12 I am not sure you will be able to do much with any of
13 this.
14 Further questions from THE CORONER
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: We have had a series of CCTV street
16 recordings of the bus. Couldn't a similar one be
17 produced for at least one car of the firearms teams?
18 I think the short answer to that is that we did. There
19 was a shot of the firearms team, in fact as it was
20 approaching Stockwell station but subject to Mr Hough,
21 I don't think we have any more.
22 MR HOUGH: I will stand ready to be corrected from behind if
23 I am wrong, but I think one of the fixed cameras that
24 was in fact panning round caught some of the -- caught,
25 I think, a couple of the firearms cars coming round.
219
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Outside Stockwell station.
2 MR HOUGH: Yes.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That is the only one that we have got.
4 MR HOUGH: Yes, there was debate at the Health and Safety
5 trial about whether a camera earlier on the route might
6 have been showing a firearms car, but I don't think it
7 was ever resolved.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Okay. The second one again I think is
9 probably not for you, Mr Esposito, but I'm going to tell
10 you what it is. I hope it's not a sexist enquiry. Why
11 are women stopped differently from men, in other words
12 not being stopped, as they are still capable of suicide
13 bombings. You may say -- I will finish it, if you say
14 it's nothing for you, that's all right. Could it be
15 possible that the four failed bombers of the previous
16 day had been replaced? I think that is a comment. I
17 don't suppose it's anything -- you are a firearms
18 officer. Nothing to do with you.
19 This one is, but I am not sure how you are going to
20 deal with it. How is it possible that the senior
21 tactical adviser to the DSO either does not know or
22 cannot remember so much? That's one question.
23 A. Because there is an awful lot going on in that morning,
24 that the details that I have been asked are about words
25 spoken, were about times, were about distances; and
220
1 those times, distances and words spoken, I never made
2 any record of, and I never paid attention to. I was
3 responsible for the tactical advice to the DSO, where
4 the team was and those issues.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
6 The second half of this question undoubtedly is not
7 for you but I will read it so counsel know what the
8 question is. Was the "possibly identical with" more
9 about image likeness, or more about perceived
10 anti-surveillance body language and normal usage of
11 mobile phone facility?
12 Again, I think you'd say that's not a matter for
13 you?
14 A. I can't answer that, sir.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well.
16 This again is not for you, but I will tell you what
17 it is. Why are police officers allowed to write
18 statements some time after the event, using just notes
19 made? Does this not leave things open for collaboration
20 and misinterpretation? Then there is a comment that the
21 public are always asked to write statements immediately
22 after the event. Is that a matter that you can deal
23 with?
24 A. No, sir.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: However, counsel now know what the
221
1 questions are.
2 Thank you, Mr Mansfield. Not a bad effort, if I may
3 say so. Mr Gibbs.
4 Questions from MR GIBBS
5 MR GIBBS: Thank you.
6 Mr Esposito, I represent the red and grey
7 surveillance teams.
8 Now, you have just been asked questions about what
9 the surveillance officers would have done at Stockwell
10 tube if they had been -- if their offer to intervene had
11 been taken up. Do I understand you to say that you can
12 tell us what they would have done?
13 A. No, I can't. I can only answer about what the training
14 would be and what I would expect and that was my advice
15 to the DSO.
16 Q. You will probably know because you have told us that you
17 have looked at the evidence from the Health and Safety
18 trial and read some parts of other people's witness
19 statements; have I got that right?
20 A. Some, sir, yes.
21 Q. That the surveillance officer, Ivor, who was in the
22 concourse at Stockwell tube later downstairs in the
23 carriage grabbed Mr de Menezes and immobilised him?
24 A. Yes, sir.
25 Q. When you imagined the position in the concourse upstairs
222
1 and the surveillance officer -- it was that same
2 surveillance officer's offer to intervene, did you
3 envisage that sort of intervention?
4 A. No, I didn't, sir.
5 Q. But as to what was going through Ivor's mind, you don't
6 purport to say that you can tell this jury that?
7 A. Absolutely none, sir.
8 Q. Can I go back to the first half of the follow of what
9 was a possible suspect. Do I understand you to say
10 that, in the control room, you understood that there had
11 been a negative identification of the man?
12 A. My comment in relation to, "They don't think it's him"
13 was from the information that I was getting off of the
14 radio, so yes, sir.
15 Q. Yes is the answer?
16 A. (Witness nods).
17 Q. You had picked up that negative identification from
18 where, do you say?
19 A. It could have only come from the surveillance monitor or
20 the speaker.
21 Q. Was that a negative identification beyond a shadow of
22 a doubt?
23 A. No, sir, it's just that they don't think it's him. It
24 was discussion between myself, the DSO, just to make
25 sure that everybody was hearing, or what I thought
223
1 I heard, and I just wanted to make sure that they heard
2 what I heard as well.
3 Q. How negative would that negative identification have had
4 to have been to your mind for it to result in either
5 a standing down of the surveillance officers and
6 a sending of them back to Scotia Road, or a decision to
7 use unarmed officers to approach the man?
8 A. I don't know. Based on the information the DSO will
9 make a decision, and that decision can only really be
10 answered by the DSO. I am there listening, but she is
11 interpreting the information and making the decisions
12 based on that information.
13 Q. From whom does she have advice as to her armed options?
14 A. That's from me, sir.
15 Q. So may I go back to the question: how negative would any
16 negative identification have to be, of the man being
17 followed, for advice to be given to -- let us
18 concentrate on the second half -- approach him with
19 unarmed officers?
20 A. At that time they would have to think that that person
21 wasn't one of the suicide terrorists.
22 Q. Yes, because if there was any risk that he might be, do
23 I have this right, if there is any risk that he might be
24 --
25 A. It would be a firearms officer's intervention.
224
1 Q. You would have to use an armed officer?
2 A. Yes, sir.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Of course Sergeant Dingemans and the
4 SO13 team were unarmed?
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 MR GIBBS: So the negative identification in the first half
7 of the follow that you picked up, you think must have
8 come either from something you overheard on the
9 surveillance radio or something that Pat, the
10 surveillance monitor, said?
11 A. Yes, sir.
12 Q. Was his log being screened?
13 A. I don't know, sir. There were logs up there, I am not
14 sure which log he was referring to.
15 Q. The only reason I ask is that I think you, on another
16 occasion, said that at one point you asked for the font
17 size to be changed?
18 A. Yes. Sitting at the back, I remember asking, because it
19 was coming up in small writing, for one of the logs for
20 them to change the font size just so that we could see
21 it.
22 Q. So that from your position at the back of the room you
23 were able to read it?
24 A. Yes, sir.
25 Q. Was it changed?
225
1 A. Yes, I believe it was.
2 Q. In the second half of the follow, you have told us that
3 there was -- it was your impression that a positive
4 identification had been made?
5 A. That's the impression I formed, yes, sir.
6 Q. You got that from where?
7 A. From the same sources, from the surveillance.
8 Q. So either from the radio that you were listening to?
9 A. Yes, sir.
10 Q. Or from Pat, the monitor?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Whereabouts during the follow, or when was it that you
13 got that positive identification?
14 A. I don't -- I really don't want to appear that I don't
15 know, but I can't say exactly when it was. It was just
16 as a result of the surveillance conversation coming on,
17 the chatter that was coming over, a series of things
18 said that made me then think, this is the subject.
19 Q. What were the words that made you think that?
20 A. "possibly identical with", again, "they think it's him",
21 or whatever, I don't know.
22 Q. "possibly identical with", we will hear, was said.
23 "they think it's him" may well have been something that
24 Pat passed on to the room. Where did your positive
25 identification come from?
226
1 A. From all of that, if it says "possibly identical with"
2 or "probably identical with", they think it's him. If
3 somebody says, "They think it's him", then to me it's
4 that subject. It's my level of belief.
5 Q. It may be as simple as this, then, is it, that if you
6 heard the words from Pat or from somebody else, "They
7 think it's him", that for you constituted a positive
8 identification?
9 A. That, along with everything else that was going on, yes,
10 sir.
11 Q. The other things were?
12 A. What I perceived to be anti-surveillance, all the other
13 issues, texting of the mobile phone -- which now we know
14 not to be the case -- but all of that built up a picture
15 in my mind as to what was happening.
16 Q. Because, as other witnesses have told us when I have
17 asked them, there is a distinction, isn't there, between
18 what a surveillance officer over a radio may say about
19 what he is seeing, what somebody looks like, what that
20 person is doing, which direction he is moving in, what
21 he is wearing, all of those pieces of raw data?
22 A. Yes, sir.
23 Q. And on the other hand the conclusions which may be drawn
24 in the control room from that raw data --
25 A. Yes, sir.
227
1 Q. -- and from the raw data that's being received from the
2 other sources available to the control room?
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. So that it is the job of someone in the control room to
5 reach conclusions based upon data and to give orders
6 based upon those conclusions?
7 A. That's the DSO, sir.
8 Q. So your "possible identical with" and "they think it's
9 him", you put together with -- don't let me put words
10 into your mouth but just see if I have got it right --
11 the fact that he had got on and off a bus?
12 A. Yes, sir.
13 Q. The fact that he had got -- I beg your pardon, the other
14 way around, the fact that he had got off and then back
15 on to a bus?
16 A. Yes, sir.
17 Q. The fact that he was making a telephone call or text
18 messages?
19 A. All of those issues, yes, sir.
20 Q. That he had been seen looking over his shoulder earlier;
21 do you remember that?
22 A. There was an awful lot said during that follow.
23 Q. Descriptions of how he was behaving, whether he was
24 nervous or not?
25 A. Yes, sir.
228
1 Q. Did all of that factor in for you?
2 A. Yes, sir. Yes. I make a determination -- not
3 a determination, I form an opinion based on what I am
4 told, what I hear.
5 Q. Just so that we understand, obviously you have got to
6 a state of opinion which you describe as "beyond
7 a shadow of a doubt" or "without a shadow of a doubt"?
8 A. No, I believed the subject to be Nettle Tip at that
9 time. I am not sure whether I used that phrase.
10 Q. I don't attempt to contradict that. I am just
11 interested in how you got there, that's all, because you
12 have obviously said that what went wrong here was
13 misidentification?
14 A. Yes, sir.
15 Q. And I represent the red and grey surveillance teams.
16 A. I understand that, sir, yes.
17 Q. Could I ask you to look -- in fact it may be easiest to
18 do it on screen -- at tab 20, a diagram of the room you
19 were in. If we have just the left-hand side. Is Pat at
20 S1?
21 A. I believe so, sir, yes.
22 Q. In C3 and C1, have we got Nick and Owen?
23 A. As I understand, yes, sir.
24 Q. You are between A3 and A4?
25 A. Yeah, there were some extra chairs there at that time
229
1 and some extra terminals.
2 Q. That's what I am just going to ask you about. I'm going
3 to ask that that stays on screen but that you do indeed
4 take out the jury bundle which you will find in front of
5 you and go to tab 21. Anyone else who wants to follow
6 should do the same. In tab 21 we have some photographs,
7 and the photograph I would like you to turn to, please,
8 is 33C.
9 A. Yes, sir.
10 Q. The photographer is standing, looking at our diagram of
11 the room, somewhere behind where, roughly where C2 is
12 marked, isn't he?
13 A. Yes, just to one side.
14 Q. Can we see in fact that C2, the chair and the desk has
15 been moved across and tacked along beside where A4 is in
16 our diagram so that there are four chairs along the back
17 and the monitors in front of C2 are now in the back row.
18 Do you see what I am saying?
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 Q. If we turn to 33A, the first photograph there, which is
21 looking back across the room from the other direction,
22 we can see that the --
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Sorry, 33 which?
24 MR GIBBS: 33A, sir.
25 We can see down the far end of the room that the
230
1 chairs and monitors for C3 and C1 are where they are
2 shown, but indeed C2 and its desk is in the back row?
3 Do you see what I am saying?
4 A. Yes. Well, I think I do, sir.
5 Q. It's just that the diagram may not be quite the same as
6 the photographs.
7 A. My understanding is the back row table was a little bit
8 longer than that, went a little bit over to the
9 right-hand side of the --
10 Q. Longer than the one that's shown in the diagram?
11 A. Yes, sir.
12 Q. And like the one that's shown in the photograph?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. So that if we had to choose between the two as to how it
15 was on that day, it would be the photograph?
16 A. It's the photograph as opposed to this diagram.
17 Q. If we go back to 33C, were you in the chair closest to
18 the photographer with the blue file on the table, or
19 further along?
20 A. The next one along, but there were more chairs than
21 that, because Callum was sitting next to me.
22 Q. Callum on your right or left?
23 A. I can't remember, sir.
24 Q. What are the monitors on the desk in front of the end
25 chair?
231
1 A. I think they are camera monitors, sir. I think they are
2 camera monitors, I don't know.
3 Q. As for the other people in the room, and I am looking at
4 the diagram again, we know that Commander Dick and
5 Mr Boutcher and others were in the area in front of C3
6 and C1 for part of the time at least; am I right about
7 that?
8 A. Yes, they did stand up and ...
9 Q. We know that Brian, who had been at A2, came forward and
10 knelt down beside Pat at S1; do you remember that?
11 A. S1, yes.
12 Q. We know that there was another surveillance monitor who
13 was a man called Harrison who was at S2; do you remember
14 that?
15 A. No, I don't, sir.
16 Q. We know that a senior officer called Mr Johnston was
17 standing for at least part of the time roughly behind S2
18 in the gap between the two banks of desks; do you
19 remember that?
20 A. I know Mr Johnston was in the room but where he was
21 standing, I don't know.
22 Q. Were the other seats filled?
23 A. My recollection is that most of the seats were filled,
24 sir.
25 Q. Were there other people standing?
232
1 A. During the course of the day there was some people
2 standing, some people sitting, people were moving around
3 all the time.
4 Q. What were they doing?
5 A. Their various functions, as I understand.
6 Q. During the half hour of the follow, what were they
7 doing?
8 A. Listening to the surveillance monitor, talking on the
9 radio, talking on mobile phones, and undertaking their
10 roles.
11 Q. Having just reminded you where people were, and what
12 they were doing, could you just be clear for me whether
13 you say that from your seat there you were able to hear
14 what was being said on the surveillance radio coming
15 from Pat's desk?
16 A. Initially I was sitting here. I did get up and I did
17 walk around and I did end up walking around standing
18 directly next to the DSO.
19 Q. Yes, you told us, I think, earlier today -- let me just
20 get your words exactly right -- that you didn't stand up
21 until right at the end. What do you mean by "right at
22 the end"?
23 A. When I had the open phone line with Trojan 84 at the
24 end, just before that I went up and stood next to the
25 DSO.
233
1 Q. Thank you. Now, you told us that you had had an open
2 telephone line with Trojan 84 for much of the follow?
3 A. It was a series of phone calls, there was a mobile phone
4 call and there were landline phone calls to Trojan 84.
5 Q. We know from your mobile telephone billing, I think,
6 that you made a telephone call to Trojan 84 on your
7 mobile telephone which began at 9.59.
8 A. I think he called me, sir.
9 Q. He called you, I beg your pardon, yes, thank you very
10 much. So you were on your mobile telephone at that
11 time?
12 A. Yes, sir.
13 Q. Up until then, had you been on your landline?
14 A. I think I made a phone call to Trojan 84 a little bit
15 earlier. I would have to look at my phone record now,
16 sir, but I had been on the landline as well, so I had
17 been seated.
18 Q. So was the moment when you stood up and went up by the
19 DSO the moment at 9.59, when you were on the mobile
20 telephone to Trojan 84?
21 A. It must have been before that, sir, but exactly when
22 again I don't know, it was in that period.
23 Q. A number of witnesses have described what they heard
24 Pat, the surveillance monitor, say. Of course he had
25 headphones on, didn't he?
234
1 A. As I understand, yes.
2 Q. Was that so that he could hear the surveillance channel?
3 A. Yes, sir. He had headphones on and he was listening to
4 the surveillance channel, yes.
5 Q. Did you understand why it was, in terms of the
6 audibility of the channel, that he had put the
7 headphones on?
8 A. So he could concentrate on what was being said, I would
9 imagine.
10 Q. Yes. I am not going to repeat what all the other
11 witnesses have said about it, but more than one
12 remembers him using words like, "They think it's him".
13 Do you remember him using words like that?
14 A. Yes, sir.
15 Q. Could anything that you said have contributed to the
16 building impression of a positive identification, do you
17 think, Mr Esposito?
18 A. I don't think so because I don't think I said a lot
19 about that. I was either on the phone to Trojan 84,
20 talking to the DSO, and I was really concentrating on
21 what the tactical options were. I may have said some
22 things, I don't know now, I can't remember now.
23 Q. Trojan 84 is going to come and give evidence, obviously,
24 and he's represented in this room and not by myself.
25 But do you remember passing any information to him about
235
1 the identification?
2 A. I remember having discussion with him about what the
3 person was wearing, and generally what was happening.
4 I was trying to relay to him information that was in the
5 room and it was a discussion because he would have been
6 listening to exactly the same thing.
7 Q. Yes, because he would have had the surveillance channel
8 on in the car that he was in, wouldn't he?
9 A. Yes, sir.
10 Q. Would he also have had the 75 channel, which was the
11 firearms radio?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Would he also have had a mobile telephone to speak to
14 you and to others?
15 A. Yes, sir.
16 Q. Would Mr Purser, the Silver on the ground, also have
17 been in that car?
18 A. Yes, sir.
19 Q. Would he have also been, did you understand this, on the
20 telephone to Commander Dick?
21 A. That's my understanding, yes, sir.
22 Q. Did you say to Trojan 84, do you think, at any stage,
23 that the man being followed was identical with our man?
24 A. I don't remember saying that to Trojan 84.
25 Q. One of the things you said earlier on today, I think,
236
1 was that there is a possibility with these radios of
2 misunderstandings developing. Do you agree with that?
3 A. There are often communication failures, yes. Sometimes
4 the radio goes through spots that you can't hear.
5 Q. There was a reference in a log which we looked at today,
6 I think it was Callum's log, at 9.41 I think was the
7 entry. Perhaps we could bring it up on screen so
8 I don't quote it wrong:
9 "As of 9.41 comms with surveillance team", does it
10 say?
11 A. Yes, sir.
12 Q. What was that about?
13 A. I think that's referring to, if that call sign is
14 correct, that would be with the orange team because
15 that's their call sign.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What, TJ802?
17 A. Trojan 802 is a generic call sign for orange team.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well.
19 MR GIBBS: We looked at a note yesterday when a witness
20 called Owen was giving evidence, and he had a note, if
21 Tom's got it, it could come up on screen. There is one
22 reference in here, in the middle of the page. I just
23 wanted to ask you about that. I wonder whether it might
24 be the same thing.
25 Do you see:
237
1 "VE why no comms..."
2 A. Yes, sir.
3 Q. "... me [that I suppose must be Owen] should be able to
4 talk to each other (confirmed when Trojan Bravo asked
5 permission) not answered."
6 Do you remember what that was about? Was there
7 a problem with the communications?
8 A. No, I don't remember that, sir.
9 Q. You don't remember asking Owen, "Why are there no
10 comms"?
11 A. Whether or not I was referring to has it gone quiet,
12 I don't know. I actually can't really remember that,
13 sir.
14 Q. If you had been asking such a question, must it have
15 been as a result of something that was being said to
16 you?
17 A. If I asked that question, it could either have been
18 something said to me or something I was hearing or not
19 hearing.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Or not hearing, yes.
21 MR GIBBS: Do you remember anyone, for instance Trojan 84,
22 having a problem with the communications?
23 A. No, sir.
24 Q. We can see that it's confirmed when Trojan Bravo, would
25 that be one of the firearms cars?
238
1 A. Yes, it would be, sir.
2 Q. Asked permission?
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. That would mean that he was actually speaking on to the
5 surveillance radio?
6 A. If you are asking for permission, it means because
7 an active follow is going on, and somebody else who is
8 not a surveillance officer wants to talk, you ask for
9 permission to talk on the radio before you just butt in,
10 because there may be something important being said.
11 Q. Thank you. Finally this, just to make sure I have
12 understood it: here are three simple words, all of which
13 might describe levels of identification, and they are
14 "possible", "probable", and "positive". If they are
15 being used about a man who is suspected of being the
16 person who tried to murder a lot of people the day
17 before, without warning, would any of those three levels
18 of identification require in your view an armed stop to
19 take place?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Which of the three?
22 A. It would have only be if it was clearly a negative. If
23 there was any threat or risk --
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Let us try again. Mr Gibbs has given
25 you three, possible, probable and positive. In the
239
1 context of what we are talking about --
2 A. If that then, although the decision is the DSO's, to me
3 if I was making that decision, then they would all
4 require an armed stop.
5 MR GIBBS: Sir, that was what I meant by the question.
6 I think we have spent a certain amount of time, you see,
7 examining possible and probable and positive, but unless
8 I have misunderstood it, would I be right in thinking
9 that even if everyone only thought it was a possible,
10 but a possible mass murderer, then it would have to be
11 an armed intervention to approach him?
12 A. It would depend on the information that you had and the
13 background, but in short, yes, sir, if you felt that
14 there was a threat from that person, then an appropriate
15 response would be a firearms response.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: An armed stop means an SFO stop, CO19
17 stop?
18 A. CO19 or whatever resources are there, sir, but an armed
19 stop.
20 MR GIBBS: Now, Ivor was in the concourse, as we have heard
21 and he was, we may hear, offering or asking whether the
22 control room would like him to attempt to intervene.
23 Your view was against that?
24 A. Yes, sir.
25 Q. Because?
240
1 A. Because of the threat and risk that existed at that
2 time.
3 Q. But the offer?
4 A. It was a very brave one, sir, but ... it's an offer
5 that's considered and only the DSO can make the decision
6 as to which resource they want to use. I'll offer
7 advice on it based on what I know about their training,
8 what I know about the circumstances, and the threat.
9 Q. But there is a word for the offer, isn't there, and it's
10 the word you have just used?
11 A. Brave.
12 MR GIBBS: Thank you.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you, Mr Gibbs.
14 Well, that will, I think, do for today. I am afraid
15 you will have to come back tomorrow.
16 A. Thank you, sir.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I have a question which I am not going
18 to put. I will explain why, because it asks for this
19 witness's opinion about another person's state of mind
20 and he can't do that, but I will leave it out for any
21 counsel who wish to see it. Can't very well ask for
22 what Trojan 84 thought.
23 Can I ask you to be back reasonably bright eyed and
24 bushy tailed at 9.30 tomorrow morning and we will go on
25 then. Thank you all very much.
