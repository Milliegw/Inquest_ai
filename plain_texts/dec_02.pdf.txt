4 (In the presence of the jury)
5 SUMMING-UP
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
7 It's nice to see you back. Well, now, we meet again.
8 It's just over ten weeks since we started here on
9 22 September, and we now embark on the closing stages of
10 this inquest into the tragic, tragic death of
11 Jean Charles de Menezes.
12 It's now for me to sum up the whole matter to you
13 before I invite you, later this week, to retire and to
14 consider the verdicts that you will return.
15 Let me first of all tell you how I propose to
16 proceed from now on. First of all, it's very tiring for
17 you to listen to a single voice non-stop. It's pretty
18 hard on the owner of the voice as well, as a matter of
19 fact, so I will have a number of breaks as we go on to
20 give you a chance to stretch your legs and for me as
21 well. Also for the same reason, I don't intend to sit
22 as late as we have been sitting while you were hearing
23 the inquest, when there were a lot of people to get
24 through, so it will be slightly more relaxed as far as
25 timing is concerned.
39
1 Again, please, if you, any of you, need a break, you
2 don't need to send me a note. Just put your hand up and
3 say, "Can I have a break?", and you shall have it.
4 There is no problem. All you have to do is ask. Okay?
5 Thank you very much.
6 Well, now, in summing this whole inquest up to you,
7 I have two tasks. I have to direct you on the law. The
8 law is my responsibility. You must take the law from
9 me.
10 My second task is to summarise the evidence to you,
11 to remind you of its salient features and to draw your
12 attention to what appear to me to be the more important
13 issues in the case. In the course of our investigation,
14 we have of course covered a large amount of ground, and
15 that is as it should be, but inevitably some parts of
16 the material that we have covered will turn out, after
17 examination, to have been more pertinent than others.
18 But just as the law is for me, so the facts are for
19 you. It is for you to decide what evidence is relevant
20 and significant, what evidence you accept, and what you
21 reject, which witnesses you think are honest, accurate
22 and reliable. It's your view that counts. It's not any
23 view that you may think that I have. My views don't
24 matter. If you think I have a view about a particular
25 aspect of the evidence, and it doesn't accord with
40
1 yours, then you should reject it.
2 Equally, if I don't refer in the course of this
3 summing-up to evidence which you consider important, you
4 should not be deflected from taking that evidence into
5 account because I haven't referred to it. You are the
6 judges of the facts. It's for you to decide what
7 evidence is important, and what is not, and you must
8 consider all the evidence that's been put before you
9 over the course of the 36 days that we actually heard
10 evidence in this inquest.
11 In summing up the facts to you, I don't intend to
12 repeat all that you have heard, it was seven weeks in
13 fact, over the seven weeks of evidence that you have sat
14 through. I am reasonably sure that you would not
15 welcome the suggestion that we should all sit here for
16 another seven weeks while I simply read through all the
17 evidence that you have heard. This is a summing-up. It
18 is, and is intended to be, a summary.
19 On the other hand, you did ask me, before we parted
20 last time, whether you could see the statements.
21 I think I may have misunderstood what you said, because
22 I rather thought that you meant the statements that the
23 witnesses had made, the basis on which they gave
24 evidence to you, and I told you, as indeed is the case,
25 that you could not see those documents.
41
1 However, there will be in your room a complete
2 transcript of the 36 days of evidence that you have
3 heard, and it's there for you to refer to during your
4 deliberations if you need it.
5 Each day's hearings are tagged, they are in folders,
6 each day is indexed, so that you can conveniently find
7 the evidence of any individual witness who gave evidence
8 during that day, whom you may wish to refer to.
9 Can I say, however, as strongly as I possibly can:
10 I do advise you against trying to read through it from
11 beginning to end. That's not really the purpose of the
12 transcript. It's there for your reference, as
13 a reference volume -- reference four volumes actually --
14 if you need it. Your assessments and impressions of the
15 evidence and of the witnesses who gave that evidence
16 will have been accumulating over the period of time that
17 you were hearing the evidence, and those impressions and
18 assessments are every bit as important as the cold print
19 of the transcripts, any of the transcripts, that you may
20 refer to.
21 Bear in mind the importance of considering all the
22 evidence on a particular point. Don't be unfairly
23 selective. If you are looking at the transcripts, bear
24 this point in mind, it's a further point which I shall
25 elaborate to you later: evidence comes from the
42
1 witnesses, not from counsel, however much they might
2 like to think it did; the evidence comes from the
3 witnesses.
4 You have, I know, because I was watching, making
5 your own notes as you have gone along and you have
6 asked, as I said you could, a significant number of
7 questions of your own. I have no doubt, as I say, that
8 you have clear impressions. I may revive them for you
9 as I summarise the evidence, but your impressions and
10 assessments of the witnesses are of paramount
11 importance.
12 As I said many times already, and I do not hesitate
13 to repeat it again, you decide the case on the evidence
14 that you have heard in this court, and not on anything
15 else that you may have seen, read or heard elsewhere.
16 Again, therefore, as I told you at the outset of
17 this inquest, please continue to ignore -- as I am sure
18 you have done -- media reports on the proceedings.
19 Again, as I have said before, don't conduct your own
20 investigations on the internet or elsewhere. Your duty
21 is to find the facts and reach a conclusion on the
22 evidence which is before you, which is the evidence that
23 was laid before you in this court.
24 Don't ask for any further evidence. There will be
25 none. The time for evidence is over. Over the past six
43
1 months, in fact, my team, assisted by the Independent
2 Police Complaints Commission, have trawled exhaustively
3 through the vast volume of documentation that has been
4 created in relation to this tragic death. We are as
5 sure as we can be that there is nothing more of any
6 materiality or relevance that could be put before you.
7 So that's it.
8 In the course of this inquest, you have heard
9 evidence from one member of Mr de Menezes' family, and
10 you heard statements from others of his family read.
11 During the hearing, I don't doubt you all saw his
12 mother, sitting at the side of the court, listening
13 intently, through the earphones that she had, with the
14 benefit of the translation facilities that were
15 available, to the evidence as it developed. I know that
16 your hearts will have gone out to her. By the same
17 token, before you heard a word of evidence in this case,
18 you must all have felt disquiet at the fact that
19 an innocent member of the public could be shot and
20 killed by trained firearms officers of the
21 Metropolitan Police.
22 Equally, when you consider the problems that were
23 facing the police on this particular occasion, you may
24 feel a tendency to sympathise with their position,
25 facing as they were a terrorist situation of this kind.
44
1 But these are emotional reactions, ladies and
2 gentlemen, and you are charged with the duty of
3 returning a verdict on the evidence. You must decide
4 and assess what you make of the evidence
5 dispassionately. Put aside any emotions, whatever they
6 may be, your own emotions, put them on one side.
7 I come back to what I mentioned a moment ago.
8 I stress also that the evidence that you have to
9 consider in this case is the evidence that comes from
10 the witnesses, whether they gave live evidence before
11 you or through the statements that have been read to
12 you.
13 Counsel, who act in accordance with their
14 professional duty to the various interested persons by
15 whom they are instructed, put to many witnesses in the
16 form of lengthy and sometimes very seductive and
17 argumentative questions, their proposals or suggestions
18 as to the appropriate way in which police investigations
19 of the kind that we are considering should be conducted.
20 But I stress, as I have said already, counsel's
21 questions are not evidence. They will only become
22 evidence if, and insofar as, the witnesses to whom the
23 question is directed agrees with and accepts the
24 proposition or suggestion that's being put. I say to
25 you again: the evidence comes from the witnesses, not
45
1 from the barristers. Bear that in mind again when you
2 are referring to the transcripts.
3 You have had some statements read to you by counsel
4 to the inquest. Some of those, such as the statements
5 of the members of the de Menezes family, were read
6 because nobody regarded them as controversial, and you
7 were told that at the time. Those statements you may
8 effectively regard as agreed evidence and give them full
9 effect as you think they should be.
10 Other statements, such as those of some of the
11 bystander witnesses in the railway carriage, were read
12 to you as hearsay evidence, although they were not
13 necessarily agreed to by all the interested parties.
14 But there was simply a consensus that it was not
15 necessary, it wasn't justifiable on grounds of upheaval
16 and disturbance and expense to call the witnesses and
17 have his or her evidence tested under examination by the
18 advocates.
19 Bear that in mind, therefore, when you are
20 considering some of the evidence that you heard,
21 particularly those of the bystander witnesses which were
22 not effectively entirely uncontroversial. They weren't
23 necessarily entirely agreed to.
24 Having mentioned the advocates, can I say a little
25 bit more about them. As I told you when I opened this
46
1 inquest, counsel for the inquest, that's Mr Hilliard
2 Queen's Counsel and Mr Hough, are here to act entirely
3 impartially, and as such, it was their task to examine
4 the witnesses first on the facts relevant to the
5 inquiry. They have also, of course, as part of that
6 task, to assist you, tested the evidence of the
7 witnesses generally.
8 Interested persons, in the form of the de Menezes
9 family, and altogether I think six organisations or
10 groups of persons that have been featured in this
11 inquest, are entitled to be represented and they all
12 have been. Counsel for interested persons are here to
13 represent their clients, to bring out any additional
14 facts that may be perceived to be relevant to their
15 clients' interests, and to challenge any evidence with
16 which their clients disagree.
17 There is always a tendency to become adversarial
18 when challenging what a witness may have said, and
19 I have already told you, and I repeat, that an inquest
20 is a fact-finding exercise and not a trial, not to
21 establish either criminal or civil liability. The
22 Coroners' Rules prohibit any verdict that appears to
23 determine civil liability generally or criminal
24 liability of any named person. The underlying basic
25 purpose of an inquiry of this kind is to establish the
47
1 true facts, to resolve the central issues of fact, and
2 to ensure that unsubstantiated speculation and rumours
3 are dispelled.
4 You will appreciate that Mr Mansfield acts for the
5 family of Mr de Menezes, and so he's in rather
6 a different position from that of the other interested
7 persons. He doesn't have a client who can give him
8 instructions about what did or did not happen at any
9 particular time on 21 or 22 July 2005, and it's only
10 fair that I should remind you of that fact.
11 This inquest is an unusual one, in a number of
12 respects, not least its length, and its complexity.
13 It's also unusual in so far that there has already been
14 a trial by jury to determine the statutory criminal
15 liability of the Office of the Commissioner of
16 Metropolitan Police in relation to the Health and Safety
17 at Work Act 1974.
18 The particulars of the offence in that trial were,
19 so far as is relevant, that the Office of the
20 Commissioner, and I'll quote now from the indictment:
21 "The Office of the Commissioner, between
22 20 July 2005 and 23 July 2005, being an employer within
23 the meaning of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974,
24 failed to conduct its undertaking, namely the
25 investigation and surveillance of a location believed to
48
1 be connected with a suspected suicide bomber, and the
2 planning and implementation of the surveillance,
3 pursuit, arrest and detention of a suspected suicide
4 bomber, and the prevention of a suicide bombing in such
5 a way as to ensure that ..."
6 Then some irrelevant words are omitted:
7 "... members of the public, including Jean Charles
8 de Menezes, were not exposed to risks to their health
9 and safety in contravention of the duty imposed by
10 Section 3, subsection 1 of the Health and Safety at Work
11 Act 1974."
12 The result of that trial, as you heard, was that the
13 Office of the Commissioner was convicted, and made the
14 subject of a substantial financial penalty. The jury
15 also returned a rider to its verdict, in the following
16 terms. I quote:
17 "In reaching this verdict, the jury attach no
18 personal culpability to Commander Dick."
19 The law is that your finding as to the cause of
20 death should not be inconsistent with the outcome of
21 that trial. There is in fact very little risk of this
22 happening. The simple verdict of guilty returned by
23 that jury does not enable us to identify which of the
24 several complaints levelled against the Office of the
25 Commissioner by the prosecution in that case the jury
49
1 found proved. There was just a simple guilty verdict,
2 that's all.
3 So far as the jury's rider is concerned, it's by no
4 means clear whether this is any part of the outcome of
5 that trial. But in any event, it's not your role to
6 attach criminal or civil fault to any named person, and
7 you are not permitted to return any verdict which might
8 have that effect.
9 What, then, is to be your approach to the witnesses
10 whose evidence you have heard in this case? First of
11 all, as I have already indicated, you will consider the
12 evidence of those witnesses who deal directly with the
13 events of 21 and 22 July, in order to decide whether the
14 witnesses themselves are honest, accurate and reliable
15 in their recollection, assisted as they have been by the
16 statements which in almost all cases they made shortly
17 after the happening of the relevant events.
18 In addition, you are also permitted as a matter of
19 common sense to draw conclusions or inferences from the
20 facts as you find them to be. You should bear in mind,
21 however, that much of the evidence you have heard
22 relating to the events from about 9.30 on the morning of
23 22 July onwards relates to a dynamic series of events,
24 moving at an ever accelerating speed towards
25 an unexpected, shocking and frightening crisis of events
50
1 which culminated in the shooting of Mr de Menezes.
2 Against that background, you will have to consider
3 very carefully the possibility that individual witnesses
4 may be mistaken, may be confused, may simply have failed
5 to recollect events in the correct sequence, in the heat
6 of the moment, including quite significant events. You
7 may remember that many witnesses, particularly the
8 bystander witnesses, many witnesses spoke of their
9 recollection being of the snapshot variety, with gaps,
10 and the evidence of the bystander witnesses, whether
11 they were given orally from the witness box or in the
12 statements that were read to you, you may think were
13 eloquent testimony as to the extent to which individual
14 recollections can vary when they are describing events
15 of that kind.
16 You also have to guard against being wise with
17 hindsight. Everybody's agreed about that. Indeed, on
18 occasions Mr Mansfield expressly said, when he was
19 advancing particular criticisms, that it should have
20 been obvious at the time that a particular approach or
21 tactic was flawed; and you have to look, obviously, at
22 what would be apparent from the circumstances existing
23 at the time.
24 Hindsight, they always say, is 20/20 vision in
25 spades and you should be careful not to, as it were,
51
1 apply it unfairly.
2 You may also want to bear in mind that in human
3 affairs, perfection is not really very often achievable,
4 and frequently in these proceedings, we have been
5 concerned with matters of judgment to which there may
6 not have been any one right answer. Perfection is one
7 thing; competence is another. Everyone, of course, is
8 entitled to expect competence where a police firearms
9 operation is concerned.
10 Lies. More than one witness in the course of this
11 inquest has been accused of lying. How should you
12 approach this topic? First of all, of course, you must
13 decide whether the person whose evidence you are
14 considering has lied, rather than having simply made
15 an honest mistake. If you think it is possible that it
16 is the latter, honest mistake, rather than the former,
17 a deliberate lie, you need consider it no further, and
18 you can consider the evidence given in the light of the
19 mistake as you think it to be.
20 If you conclude that the witness has lied, then you
21 should go on to bear this in mind: people tell lies for
22 a variety of reasons, not necessarily to hide their own
23 guilt. In the context of this case, it may be to
24 mitigate the impact of what has become apparent was
25 a tragic mistake; to support others in the explanations
52
1 that they have -- they may have put forward. I will
2 give you an example. Suppose you concluded, to take
3 an issue which is at the forefront of your
4 considerations, that Charlie 12 had not shouted "armed
5 police" or that Mr de Menezes had not moved towards him;
6 you would have to ask yourselves whether he was mistaken
7 or whether he was telling a lie. Even if he was telling
8 a lie, it would not automatically follow that Charlie 12
9 could not still have been acting in lawful defence of
10 himself and of others. That's merely an example. I am
11 not expressing any view whatever about Charlie 12's
12 evidence. That's for you to decide, not me.
13 In addition, it doesn't follow that because you
14 conclude that a witness has lied in one or some matters
15 that nothing that he or she has told you can be relied
16 upon. It doesn't necessarily follow that because you
17 conclude that a witness has lied on one specific point
18 that the whole of a witness's evidence can be regarded
19 as demonstrably unreliable. It's for you to decide what
20 you can accept and what you feel constrained to reject.
21 Experts. The bulk of the evidence that you have
22 heard in this inquest has focused entirely on the
23 factual events leading up to and surrounding the death
24 of Mr de Menezes. You have also heard the evidence of
25 various senior serving and former police officers who
53
1 have been invited to give you the benefit of their
2 opinions on the appropriateness or otherwise of police
3 policies, strategies, and tactics when seeking to
4 grapple with so problematic a subject as the best way to
5 deal with the threat presented by suicide terrorist
6 bombers.
7 It's by no means unusual for evidence of this nature
8 to be permitted at an inquest, as it is indeed in many
9 criminal trials. Its purpose is to provide you with
10 information and the benefit of expert opinion which is
11 within the witness's expertise and experience but which
12 is likely to be outside your experience and knowledge,
13 or mine for that matter, as ordinary members of the
14 public.
15 Take an obvious example: you heard from the witness
16 who went under the name of Neil to assist you with the
17 characteristics, composition, and the explosive power of
18 the materials and the devices that were used in the 7/7
19 and the 21/7 attacks. You wouldn't have known anything
20 about that without the benefit of that assistance.
21 You also heard from Dr Shorrock, the consultant
22 pathologist, and Mr Tomei, the forensic scientist, as to
23 the nature of the injuries suffered by Mr de Menezes,
24 the range at which the shots appeared to have been fired
25 and the position of the body at the material time.
54
1 This evidence, together with that of Dr Mould, the
2 pharmacologist who told you about the effect of cocaine,
3 which was read to you, was evidence which was
4 effectively uncontroversial. You may take it on its
5 face value. Where there was a degree of controversy was
6 over the evidence given to you by former
7 Chief Superintendent Swain who you will remember was
8 a leading member of the working party who was tasked
9 with the development of policies and strategies and
10 tactics for dealing with suicide bombers in the
11 aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in New York.
12 He told you about the extensive research that he and
13 his working party had carried out around the world,
14 particularly in connection, his particular, what he
15 calls strand of the working party, particularly in
16 connection with tactics, training and equipment. You
17 heard about the conclusions that they came to, and about
18 the strategies that they introduced.
19 You also heard from the former Deputy Assistant
20 Commissioner Mr Paddick, who is critical of the strategy
21 that was developed by Commander McDowall for the
22 operation on 22 July, particularly in relation to the
23 designation and use of a designated senior officer,
24 a DSO, and the absence of any appropriate code words.
25 You will remember that there is some conflict between
55
1 the evidence of Mr Swain and Mr Paddick.
2 A witness who is called as an expert is entitled to
3 express an opinion in respect of the matters that he
4 deals with and on which he has expertise. These
5 officers were called as senior officers who have
6 experience and expertise on such matters. You are
7 entitled and would no doubt wish to have regard to this
8 evidence, and to the opinions that are expressed by the
9 experts, when you come to your conclusion on various
10 aspects of the case.
11 As I have said already, where there is no opposition
12 being voiced to the opinions of any of the experts, like
13 Neil or the pathologist, that sort of thing, then you
14 may have little difficulty in feeling able to rely upon
15 those opinions, where they are relevant or you find them
16 to be relevant, in your deliberations.
17 But where there is controversy, then you approach
18 such witnesses in exactly the same way as you would
19 approach any other witness in the case. You weigh up
20 the impression that each witness makes upon you, and you
21 assess what weight you feel that you can give to that
22 witness's opinions. And in particular in this case, you
23 may wish to consider the level and extent of the
24 expertise and experience that you think that each such
25 witness is able to bear on the topics in respect of
56
1 which he is giving you his opinion.
2 The evidence that you have heard in this inquest has
3 presented a graphic illustration of the topic that's
4 already been referred to by counsel from time to time;
5 that is the difficulty of achieving a reliable, positive
6 identification of any person whose identity is in
7 question.
8 Juries in our criminal courts always have to be
9 reminded about how careful one must be in approaching
10 what may appear to be confident identification evidence,
11 but one which is given under difficult circumstances,
12 for instance in a poor light, at a distance, for a brief
13 instant only, and so on. They are told always of the
14 need for special caution in such cases because
15 experience has shown that ghastly mistakes can be made.
16 It's because of this well recognised difficulty that
17 it may be unreasonable to expect officers, surveillance
18 officers or any other police officers in the context of
19 this case, to be able to establish with confidence the
20 identity of a person who is under surveillance until
21 observation has been able to be maintained over
22 a significant period of time.
23 As I told you at the start of the case, the law
24 states that the function of a Coroner's jury is to
25 answer four important but limited questions: who the
57
1 deceased was; when he came by his death; where he came
2 by his death; and how he came by his death. That last
3 phrase means by what means and in what circumstances he
4 came by his death. You are not limited to looking at
5 the immediate physical cause of death.
6 In addition, you are required to confirm various
7 formal matters which are required for the registration
8 of death. Beyond those matters that I have told you
9 about, you are not entitled to express an opinion on any
10 other matter. I repeat yet again, you have heard it
11 many times, that the law prevents you from making any
12 findings which appear to determine any question of the
13 criminal liability of a named individual or any question
14 of civil liability whatever.
15 However, you are entitled to express judgmental
16 conclusions of a factual nature. The law requires me to
17 consider, after I have received your verdict, whether
18 I should make any recommendations to the relevant public
19 bodies for any changes in their future procedures and
20 practices. But that's my responsibility.
21 So, legal directions. I now turn to direct you as
22 to the verdicts that I am going to invite you to
23 consider. Conventionally and traditionally the verdicts
24 of a Coroner's jury are expressed in brief and in some
25 cases uninformative terms. These are what are known as
58
1 short form verdicts. They include those that are
2 familiar to you, and to the press, and to the public
3 alike, such verdicts as suicide or accidental death.
4 Of course, suicide and accidental death obviously
5 could in no way be appropriate in the circumstances of
6 this case. Of the other short form verdicts that are
7 available, it is my responsibility to determine whether
8 any and, if so, which the law allows to be left to you
9 to consider, and this is my duty. I am only permitted
10 to leave a verdict to you if there is sufficient
11 evidence, taken at its highest, to permit a jury,
12 properly directed, properly to return such a verdict.
13 On Thursday and Friday of the week before last,
14 having considered extensive written submissions from all
15 the interested persons, I heard oral submissions again
16 from all persons including counsel to the inquest.
17 I have considered all those submissions, and the
18 conclusion that I have come to, and I so direct you, is
19 that the evidence in this case taken at its highest
20 would not justify my leaving verdicts of unlawful
21 killing to you. This is so in respect of Charlie 12 and
22 Charlie 2, concerning their direct involvement in the
23 shooting of Mr de Menezes, and also in respect of any of
24 the particular senior officers in relation to their
25 management and conduct of the operation which was
59
1 designed to find, follow and detain a suicide bomber.
2 I so conclude, bearing in mind, as I must, the
3 extremely high standard of proof on the criminal basis
4 which is required before you could properly come to such
5 a verdict. In other words, a verdict of that kind could
6 only be returned if a jury were sure beyond reasonable
7 doubt that Mr de Menezes had been unlawfully killed.
8 Now, in directing you that you cannot return
9 a verdict of unlawful killing, I am not saying that
10 nothing went wrong in a police operation which resulted
11 in the killing of an innocent man. All interested
12 persons agree that a verdict of unlawful killing could
13 only be left to you if you could be sure that a specific
14 officer, a specific officer, had committed a very
15 serious crime, murder or manslaughter.
16 In these circumstances, the law does not allow for
17 an unlawful verdict(sic) to be left or returned on the
18 basis that a number of people made different mistakes,
19 the cumulative effect of which was to result in the
20 death of Mr de Menezes; and in any event, as I shall
21 tell you, I shall be leaving to you verdicts and
22 conclusions which will allow you to determine whether
23 the use of force by the officers Charlie 2 and
24 Charlie 12 was legally justified and which allow you to
25 determine what factors led to the death.
60
1 I will leave for your consideration the option to
2 return either a verdict of lawful killing or an open
3 verdict. That choice will allow you to determine
4 a central issue in the case; that is whether the use of
5 force by Charlie 2 and Charlie 12 was justified. All
6 interested persons are agreed that you could properly
7 return either of those verdicts, and they are obviously
8 alternatives, either of those verdicts depending on your
9 assessment of the evidence. I shall shortly be telling
10 you how to approach those verdicts.
11 In order to understand the law that you must apply
12 in relation to these verdicts, you must first understand
13 that although the verdicts that are in use in this
14 context in a Coroner's court use the slightly bland
15 expressions of "lawful" or "unlawful killing", the
16 accusation that is in fact being made against Charlie 2
17 and Charlie 12 on behalf of the family is an allegation
18 of murder; that is to say the deliberate killing of
19 another human being without any lawful excuse. That is
20 an allegation of murder.
21 The response of the two officers to that accusation
22 is that they were acting in the lawful defence of
23 themselves and of many other people in that they fired
24 their weapons in order to prevent the detonation of
25 a body-borne improvised explosive device, an IED, or
61
1 a bomb, which they honestly, albeit mistakenly, believed
2 that Mr de Menezes was carrying and which he intended to
3 detonate.
4 I am now going to ask my usher to hand out a set of
5 written directions on the law. (Handed). If we may, we
6 will go through them together.
7 Just take a moment, please, to glance through the
8 first section, the general directions. I am not going
9 to read them again because it repeats in effect what
10 I have just told you. (Pause). With me so far? Thank
11 you.
12 The next section begins "Short Form Verdicts", and
13 as you will see, it gives you the choice between lawful
14 killing and an open verdict, and you should consider
15 lawful killing first.
16 Then I hope you will find the next section useful
17 because it sets out in print what I have just told you.
18 A lawful killing verdict should be returned where the
19 evidence shows that it is probable, that is to say more
20 likely than not, that the deceased died by the
21 deliberate application of force against him, and that
22 the person causing the injuries used reasonable force in
23 self-defence or defence of another person, or to prevent
24 a crime, or to assist in a lawful arrest, even if that
25 force was, by its very nature or the manner of its
62
1 application, likely to be fatal.
2 I'll leave you just to read that through again for
3 yourselves. (Pause). One aspect of that definition you
4 will notice immediately is that the basis upon which you
5 approach that verdict is that it is probable, more
6 likely than not, which is the civil burden of proof and
7 not the much higher criminal burden of proof which
8 I told you a moment ago was to be sure beyond reasonable
9 doubt. It is sufficient for you to find a lawful
10 killing if you conclude that the criteria set out in
11 that section is established on the balance of
12 probabilities: more likely than not.
13 You will see that the direction provides that you
14 should return a verdict of lawful killing if you find
15 that the two officers, Charlie 2 and Charlie 12, when
16 they shot Mr de Menezes, were acting in lawful defence
17 of themselves or others. As you will see, in order to
18 return that verdict, you will have to be satisfied of
19 two matters on the balance of probabilities, and I now
20 focus on the facts of this case.
21 You must be satisfied that it's more likely than not
22 (a) that at the time they fired their weapons, they
23 honestly although mistakenly believed that Mr de Menezes
24 represented an imminent mortal danger to them and to the
25 other people around them; and (b) -- two things -- that
63
1 they used no more force than was reasonably necessary in
2 the circumstances as they honestly believed them to be.
3 When you consider question (a), you need to remember
4 that the question is whether the officers honestly
5 believed that Mr de Menezes represented an imminent and
6 mortal danger. If the answer to that question is yes,
7 then you would be saying that the officers made
8 an honest but tragic mistake. The question is not
9 whether that belief which we now know was mistaken was
10 a reasonable one for them to hold. You can only
11 consider whether it was reasonable if that helps you --
12 if and insofar as that helps you to determine the real
13 question: did they actually believe this?
14 In other words, the crucial question is: did they
15 honestly and genuinely hold that belief, even though it
16 may be mistaken and even though you may think that the
17 mistake was unreasonable? The only relevance of the
18 unreasonableness is if that assists you to conclude, to
19 decide, whether they actually did hold that belief.
20 If you consider that the answer to question (a) is
21 yes, you should then consider question (b) on your
22 paper. When considering that second question, which is
23 about the reasonableness of the force used, you should
24 bear this in mind: the law says that a person who is
25 facing a threat or an attack does not have to judge too
64
1 precisely how much force he should use. He may not have
2 very much time. It can be reasonable to use lethal
3 force in self-defence.
4 You should also bear this in mind when considering
5 this verdict: the law does not require a person who is
6 under attack or is fearing an attack to wait for
7 an attack before he takes defensive action. You don't
8 have to wait until somebody is shooting at you before
9 you take appropriate defensive action. A pre-emptive
10 strike, to use the tactical expression, can be justified
11 depending on the circumstances.
12 If you think that the officers genuinely believed
13 that Mr de Menezes presented an immediate and mortal
14 threat to all around him, then you may think -- although
15 it's a matter for you -- that the use of lethal force by
16 the officers was reasonable in order to counter that
17 threat.
18 In any case, where the threat perceived is so
19 extreme, then the measures taken to deal with such
20 a threat may also have to be of an extreme nature. In
21 that respect, even if you think that more shots may have
22 been fired than was strictly necessary to ensure that
23 Mr de Menezes was incapacitated or dead, which in these
24 circumstances probably amounted to the same thing, then
25 you may think that the suggested overreaction that was
65
1 put to the officers may not perhaps be so unexpected
2 under the influence of extreme pressure, and in any case
3 you may well think that the precise number of shots may
4 have made no difference to the ultimate outcome when you
5 remember the evidence of Dr Shorrock and Mr Tomei that
6 Mr de Menezes might very well have been killed by the
7 very first shot.
8 I will remind you again of all these legal questions
9 when I come to review the evidence on these aspects of
10 matters.
11 May I now ask you, please, to look over the page of
12 the written legal directions? Again you will find set
13 out, at the top half of the second page, the directions
14 that I have just given you, and I am not going to read
15 them again.
16 Coming now to the section of the document which is
17 headed "Open Verdict". If, having considered all the
18 evidence, you consider that the necessary elements of
19 a lawful killing verdict are not established as being
20 more likely than not, then you should return an open
21 verdict; in other words if you did not conclude that the
22 officers probably held the requisite honest belief, or
23 if you did not conclude that they probably used
24 reasonable force, then you should return an open
25 verdict.
66
1 Please bear in mind the following points, and they
2 are in the document: first, you should not return
3 an open verdict just because you cannot establish
4 a peripheral point of fact about the death. Secondly,
5 you should not return an open verdict because you
6 disagree among yourselves. Whichever verdict you
7 return, as I shall be telling you at the very end of
8 this summing-up, you must all agree on it.
9 Thirdly, you should not return an open verdict as
10 a mark of disapproval or to make any sort of statement.
11 Fourthly, if you were to return an open verdict,
12 that would not represent a failure on your part, nor
13 a failure on the part of the inquest. It would be
14 simply a reflection of your view of the state of the
15 evidence that you have heard.
16 In order to enable you to give your conclusions on
17 the other central factual issues that have been debated
18 during the course of this inquest, I intend to put
19 before you a number of questions for you to consider,
20 and now, if I may, I am going to ask my usher to put
21 before you a draft form of inquisition and a draft
22 verdict questionnaire. (Handed). You should each have
23 two documents. (Pause). Please look first at the
24 inquisition. That one (indicated). You will see the
25 formal introduction. In the box, firstly it tells you
67
1 where this is all happening and the dates that we have
2 been sitting. It tells you who I am and who you are,
3 and then box 1 is written in the name of the deceased.
4 These are all uncontroversial and I have written them in
5 in advance.
6 In box number 2, the medical cause of death is
7 given: severe disruption of the brain resulting from
8 multiple gunshot wounds to the head. That you remember
9 was Dr Shorrock's finding on the post-mortem.
10 In box 3 there is the neutral and uncontroversial
11 description of the circumstances of death. It sets out
12 that Jean Charles de Menezes died as a result of being
13 shot by armed police officers of the Metropolitan Police
14 in an Underground train at Stockwell Underground station
15 at approximately six minutes past 10 on 22 July 2005.
16 In box 5, jumping 4 for a moment, are the various
17 particulars which are required for registration of
18 death. Mr de Menezes' date and place of birth, date and
19 place of death, his full name, his address at the time,
20 his occupation and so on. I am hoping, I hope with some
21 confidence, that you will find all those entries
22 uncontroversial and that you will be entirely happy to
23 subscribe to them. If you are not content with any of
24 them, please write me a note.
25 Box 4 is the key section, and as you will see, I am
68
1 not asking you to write anything in there, the
2 conclusion of the jury as to the death, because I am now
3 going to look, please, at the separate document, which
4 is the attached questionnaire, the verdict
5 questionnaire.
6 Can we look, please, at that one now. First of all,
7 there is a section for the short form verdicts that
8 I have left to you. When you have decided whether to
9 return a lawful killing verdict or an open verdict, you
10 should write that into the box marked towards the top,
11 alongside those two choices.
12 By choosing between those verdicts you will be able
13 to express your conclusion on the legal justification of
14 the force that was actually used.
15 Next, you should consider three factual questions
16 which are again central questions that have been debated
17 over the course of this inquest. The first question is:
18 did officer Charlie 12 shout the words "armed police" at
19 Mr de Menezes before firing? The second question: did
20 Mr de Menezes stand up from his seat before he was
21 grabbed in a bear hug by an officer going under the name
22 of Ivor? Third, did Mr de Menezes move towards officer
23 Charlie 12 before he was grabbed in a bear hug by
24 officer Ivor?
25 Just going back to question 1 for a moment, you will
69
1 see what is set out in the parallel box against that
2 question 1. If you conclude that it is more likely than
3 not that the officer shouted the words before firing,
4 place a tick against "yes". If you decide that it is
5 more likely than not that the officer did not shout
6 those words before firing, tick "no". If you cannot
7 give a yes or no answer on the evidence before you, tick
8 "cannot decide". It's all pretty basic, but I need to
9 recite it with you.
10 These questions, those three questions, will allow
11 you to express your conclusions about what happened in
12 the railway carriage.
13 Turn over. Question number 4 asks you to consider
14 which, if any, of a number of factors contributed to the
15 death of Mr de Menezes. There are in fact nine
16 sentences there, (a) to (i), each of which expresses
17 a factor which in the course of this inquest it has been
18 suggested made some contribution, and let me read them
19 out to you. (a), the suicide attacks and attempted
20 attacks of July 2005 and the pressure placed upon the
21 Metropolitan Police in responding to the threat.
22 (b), a failure to obtain and provide better
23 photographic images of the suspect Hussain Osman for the
24 surveillance teams.
25 (c), a failure by the police to ensure that
70
1 Mr de Menezes was stopped before he reached public
2 transport.
3 (d), the general difficulty in providing
4 an identification of the man under surveillance, that's
5 Mr de Menezes, in the time available and in the
6 circumstances after he had left the block at
7 Scotia Road.
8 (e), the innocent behaviour of Mr de Menezes which
9 increased the suspicions of some of the officers.
10 (f), the fact that the views of the surveillance
11 officers regarding identification were not accurately
12 communicated to the command team and to the firearms
13 officers.
14 (g), the fact that the position of the cars
15 containing the firearms officers was not accurately
16 known to the command team as the firearms officers were
17 approaching Stockwell station.
18 (h), any significant shortcomings in the
19 communications system as it was operating on the day,
20 between the various police teams on the ground and with
21 New Scotland Yard.
22 Finally, (i), a failure to conclude at the time that
23 surveillance officers should still be used to carry out
24 the stop of Mr de Menezes at Stockwell station, even
25 after it was reported that specialist firearms officers
71
1 could perform the stop.
2 Again, you will see, same series of choices, yes, no
3 or we can't decide.
4 Consider each of these, (a) to (i) separately. When
5 considering each, again you apply the balance of
6 probabilities standard: is it more likely than not? If
7 you decide that the sentence reasonably accurately
8 describes something which happened and that it caused or
9 made a more than minimal contribution to the death of
10 Mr de Menezes, then you should tick "yes" in the box
11 next to the sentence. If you decide that the sentence
12 either does not describe something which happened or, if
13 it did happen, you think that it did not cause or
14 contribute to the death of Mr de Menezes, you should
15 tick "no" in the box next to the particular sentence.
16 But if, on all the evidence before you, you cannot
17 decide, then you so say by ticking against the words
18 "cannot decide".
19 Now, these questions have been drafted carefully to
20 ensure that you can express your conclusions on various
21 matters which may or may not have played some part in
22 causing the death, but they are also drafted in such
23 a way, the wording has been chosen in such a way that
24 there is no risk of you infringing the legal rules that
25 I have told you about. You remember about criminal
72
1 liability and civil liability and so forth.
2 Here again in relation to those questions and
3 factors, I shall remind you of the issues raised when
4 I have concluded my review of the evidence, which I am
5 about to start. I say again that this is necessarily
6 for your sake and for mine, this is a selective review,
7 and that you should consider all the evidence that you
8 regard as significant and not just what I remind you
9 about now.
10 The strong temptation is to break off at this point.
11 You have probably had enough for a bit, and I will start
12 my review of the evidence at 2 o'clock.
13 (12.35 pm)
14 (The short adjournment)
15 (2.00 pm)
73
4 (2.13 pm)
5 (In the presence of the jury)
6 SUMMING-UP (continued)
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Two things, ladies and gentlemen.
8 First of all, I am afraid it happens from time to time,
9 there was a slip of the tongue in the directions I gave
10 you about unlawful killing, and what I am going to do,
11 instead of saying, as I now know having looked at the
12 LiveNote, instead of saying "unlawful killing verdict",
13 I said "unlawful verdict". I am going to correct it and
14 read you the paragraph again so you get the full effect
15 as it should have been. This is what I said:
16 "In directing you that you cannot return a verdict
17 of unlawful killing, I am not saying that nothing went
18 wrong in a police operation which resulted in the
19 killing of an innocent man. All interested persons
20 agree that a verdict of unlawful killing could only be
21 left to you if you could be sure that a specific officer
22 had committed a very serious crime, murder or
23 manslaughter. In these circumstances, the law does not
24 allow for an unlawful killing verdict to be left or
25 returned on the basis that a number of people made
76
1 mistakes, the cumulative effect of which was to result
2 in the death of Mr de Menezes."
3 I hope it's clear. Thank you.
4 The other thing is, before I embark on a review of
5 the evidence, I gave you -- I'll take you back
6 momentarily to the inquisition. I have given each of
7 you a copy of the inquisition document, but can I make
8 clear that when you come to return your verdict, you
9 should return one only, which you all -- I say you can
10 fill them out how you like, but what you must produce at
11 the end is a single document containing your agreed
12 answers, and if you look over the second page you will
13 see that there is provision for your signatures.
14 Thank you very much.
15 Now, I return, then, to my review of the evidence
16 which I tell you again is a summary, and that it does
17 not in any way replace your consideration of the
18 evidence which you regard as significant, not just what
19 I remind you about now. I start with the background to
20 terrorism insofar as it's relevant to this case.
21 The story really starts with the attack on the
22 Twin Towers in New York in September 2001. That was
23 an unprecedented event. Before that date, there had
24 never been a suicide terrorist attack on any Western
25 democracy. At that time there were no detailed
77
1 strategies or guidance developed in the United Kingdom
2 about suicide terrorism and indeed, there had been no
3 single case in the United Kingdom. It was rapidly
4 appreciated in this country that there was a need to
5 research and develop such strategies, and this led to
6 the setting up by the Metropolitan Police of a working
7 party to look at suicide terrorism and how to respond to
8 it.
9 Mr Swain, Mr Steve Swain, I am sure you will
10 remember, was a leading member of that working party,
11 and he was leading the strand of the research dealing
12 with tactics, training and the equipment of front line
13 police officers. This involved leading a team with
14 representatives from all the relevant parts of the
15 Metropolitan Police, SO12, SO13, CO19, and the other
16 departments connected with the public order,
17 intelligence, the information room, organisation and
18 traffic.
19 In the course of their researches, the team visited
20 over 20 countries but their principal attention was
21 focused on the three main hot spots for suicide
22 terrorism: Israel, Sri Lanka and Russia.
23 The products of Mr Swain's research can be
24 summarised in the following way. Point 1: it's not easy
25 to identify a potential suicide bomber from his
78
1 behaviour. In the early stages, it was thought that
2 nervousness, sweating, praying, reading from the Koran
3 or something of that kind was indicative, and indeed
4 that aspect of matters was still considered to be quite
5 important in July 2005. But more recent experience,
6 including the 7/7 attacks themselves, has led to the
7 conclusion that these behavioural characteristics are by
8 no means always present and nor indeed are they of
9 themselves reliable indications that the subject is
10 a suicide bomber.
11 Point 2, the commonest forms of detonation are by
12 means of a switch on the device itself which is carried
13 around the body, with a cut-out pocket or something like
14 that, to allow access by hand or a rocker switch held in
15 the hand with wires passing up the sleeve to explosives
16 carried elsewhere on the body.
17 Accordingly, in these, the commonest versions of
18 such devices, the bomber needs to have at least one of
19 his hands free in order to initiate the device.
20 The explosive used in both the 7/7 and the 21/7
21 attacks was a peroxide-based explosive. While this is
22 an explosive that can be made from chemicals that are
23 readily accessible, it is exceptionally volatile and
24 dangerous. It's so volatile that it doesn't actually
25 need a detonator. It can be set off by friction or
79
1 a blow or even by the static electricity within the
2 human body.
3 In fact, the usual detonation device will be a torch
4 bulb with the glass removed, connected to a 9-volt
5 battery. The typical size of a peroxide bomb is between
6 3 and 5 kilograms, made up into a sheet of perhaps
7 an inch thick wrapped around the body. The killing
8 range of such a bomb is something between 10 and
9 15 metres. If the bomb is covered with metal
10 fragmentation material, such as ball bearings or nuts
11 and bolts, the killing range extends out to something
12 like 150 metres.
13 I have jumped point 3, I think, without mentioning
14 it. Yes, that's the explosives.
15 Point 4, according to Mr Swain, the general method
16 of concealing such bombs is to carry them under the
17 body, concealed under clothing. A bomb of the type
18 described can be concealed -- can be concealed -- under
19 English summer clothing. There is not much variation in
20 concealment techniques. The whole point of a suicide
21 bomber is to defeat security measures and to achieve
22 penetration into an area where maximum damage can be
23 caused; and for that reason, rucksacks are extremely
24 unusual, and Mr Swain had never encountered the use of
25 a rucksack prior to the attacks of 7/7.
80
1 Point 5, when speaking about the techniques or
2 tactics developed in the rest of the world about
3 challenging suicide bombers, Mr Swain said this, and
4 I quote:
5 "It is very clear from the evidence of all the
6 places we visited that if you challenge these people
7 [and by that he was referring to suicide bombers] they
8 will blow the device up."
9 That was a very clear pattern throughout all the
10 research: if you challenge suicide bombers, they will
11 detonate the device.
12 Point 6, Mr Swain added this about tactics for
13 confrontations:
14 "In a crowded environment where it is not possible
15 to challenge from a safe distance, or to obtain suitable
16 cover, the police officer will have to get fairly close
17 and then neutralise the threat by the use of firearms."
18 I quote again:
19 "You would not want to give an oral challenge,
20 because if you did, that would give the bomber that very
21 short space of time to actually detonate the device so
22 that the whole thing about this is that you have to do
23 it covertly."
24 You will consider the more generalised guidelines
25 that are contained in the ACPO manual, Association of
81
1 Chief Police Officers, and other documents about the use
2 of firearms, and the necessity for a challenge in most
3 but importantly not all circumstances, and referring to
4 a wide variety of situations which may call for the
5 involvement of specialist firearms officers.
6 When you are considering such general guidelines,
7 you may wish to put into the scales of your
8 consideration the specific expertise that Mr Swain has
9 been able to give you when dealing with the very special
10 area of the tactics to be used when dealing with suicide
11 bombers.
12 Point 7, in that context, Mr Swain was able to
13 respond to the suggestion that was made by Mr Mansfield,
14 particularly to Mr Esposito and to Trojan 84, that in
15 Israel there is a rule that an officer must actually see
16 some kind of visible evidence of an explosive device on
17 a subject before he fires a critical shot. Mr Swain
18 told you there is no such rule, and indeed it's pretty
19 clear from what he had been told that there were
20 occasions -- in Israel at any rate -- where a critical
21 shot had been delivered when the officer concerned did
22 not have full evidence.
23 Point 8, Mr Swain also dealt with the possibility of
24 using a baton round, rubber bullet, or a taser, to
25 neutralise the suspected suicide bomber. The nature of
82
1 this peroxide-based explosive is such that a baton round
2 to the body will set the bomb off. Tasers were not in
3 general use in 2005, but if they had been, they also
4 would have set off a bomb.
5 The tactic of controlling someone by forcing him to
6 the ground, which he had heard about in Israel but had
7 never seen used in real life, notwithstanding that Ivor
8 had suggested it, he regards as too hazardous because
9 the force involved might itself be likely to cause
10 an explosion.
11 In any event, you may remember Mr Tillbrook, one of
12 the last witnesses you saw, who is the current
13 Operational Command Unit Commander in the firearms
14 branch, the CO19, he told you that in July 2005 this was
15 not a technique that the Metropolitan Police would have
16 used.
17 Point 9, by January 2003 the working party had
18 produced a presentation, both for the
19 Metropolitan Police and indeed for police within the
20 United Kingdom as a whole, setting out the policies and
21 lessons that had been learned.
22 At tab 62 of your bundle, you have two pages,
23 I simply show you to remind you what it looks like.
24 That's the Kratos People Firearms Officer Awareness
25 package. The first page deals with the position where
83
1 a person is suspected of carrying a bomb but this has
2 not been confirmed. The guidance there, as you can see,
3 is that the suspect should be challenged from a position
4 of safety. The second page relates to the situation
5 where a suspect has been identified and immediate action
6 is absolutely necessary. In such circumstances,
7 a critical head shot can be delivered.
8 The thinking behind this guidance, Mr Swain said,
9 was that in the vast majority of cases, because it would
10 be very difficult to know whether this was a suicide
11 bomber at all, then the approach would have to be
12 a challenge. But what this guidance does not deal with,
13 of course, is where a person is believed to be a suicide
14 bomber but this is not confirmed, and there is no
15 position of safety and members of the public may be in
16 a position of apparent danger.
17 Point 10, Mr Swain was asked to consider the
18 tactical options document prepared by Mr Esposito and
19 Andrew on the evening of 21 July. That's tab 42 in your
20 bundle. Just to remind you what it looks like, you will
21 find it at tab 42 in your bundle. He agreed that the
22 advice contained in that document correctly recognises
23 that where there is intelligence to suggest that the
24 suspect is a suicide bomber and is carrying an explosive
25 device, with the means of detonating it, overt
84
1 deployment is likely to endanger those around, and the
2 use of conventional tactics must be carefully considered
3 and risk assessed prior to use.
4 Then there come in the document these words, and
5 again quotes:
6 "In all these options there exists a real
7 possibility that should the subject be non-compliant
8 with the commands of the officers initiating the
9 interception, then an immediate critical shot may be
10 taken."
11 Point 11, Mr Swain pointed out that this passage,
12 which I have just read to you, reflects the position set
13 out by Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 which
14 gives officers the powers to use lethal force if they
15 think they are faced with somebody who poses such
16 an extreme threat.
17 That is something that is trained into every
18 firearms officer so that he would expect that this is
19 what they would have uppermost in their minds in that
20 situation. The Criminal Law Act 1967, in summary,
21 provides that no more force may be used than it
22 reasonably or absolutely necessary, and that is printed
23 on the blue card that every firearms officer carries.
24 Remember, you have one in your jury bundle.
25 It must be for the officer on the ground to exercise
85
1 judgment whether the subject under surveillance is
2 a bomber, and if so whether he is actually carrying
3 a bomb, and is threatening to detonate. The officer
4 involved needs to make that assessment based on any
5 intelligence that he may have, plus any other indicators
6 that he may derive from the situation as it is
7 developing in front of him, but so much depends upon the
8 circumstances.
9 While non-compliance is a factor of importance when
10 a firearms officer is deciding what he has to do, the
11 caution against alerting a person who is thought to be
12 presenting a threat means that in many cases a challenge
13 is not appropriate. If there can be no challenge, then
14 there may be no basis upon which compliance or
15 non-compliance can be fully judged, and this is another
16 of those dilemmas to which there is no answer.
17 Point 12, although the Metropolitan Police has been
18 seeking to learn the lessons from the events of 22 July
19 ever since, with a review body which is still running,
20 the whole policy is continually being reviewed. But the
21 reality is, said Mr Swain, that these are extremely
22 difficult things to deal with. He said this:
23 "Life will always be in danger in these types of
24 things, and I don't know what the answer to that is.
25 I am not even sure that there is an answer."
86
1 Mr Swain observed that there is no written guidance
2 to help officers in the exercise of the discretion one
3 way or another as to whether to fire without having
4 issued a challenge or warning, because any such guidance
5 that was attempted would simply produce a lot of
6 different "what ifs". It's not possible to cover every
7 conceivable set of circumstances. His view is that it
8 is not practicable to produce any abstract, generalised
9 words of guidance other than those that are already
10 available.
11 Point 13, Mr Swain described to you how the two
12 policies known as Operation Kratos and
13 Operation Clydesdale were developed. Kratos was for
14 situations where information comes into the police which
15 suggests the prospect of a spontaneous attack.
16 Clydesdale was for situations where an attack is
17 anticipated at a pre-planned event. For some reason the
18 Trooping of the Colour seems to crop up on every
19 occasion.
20 However, by 2005, the word "Kratos" appears to have
21 been used by some officers colloquially to cover any
22 kind of suicide bomber incident. Designated senior
23 officer or DSO was the term for the senior officer
24 nominated to take charge under the Clydesdale strategy.
25 However, by 2005, DSOs were being used for oncall
87
1 response to Kratos incidents. Mr Swain acknowledged
2 that before 2005 neither in this country nor, so far as
3 he was aware, anywhere else in the world had anyone
4 considered the problems that might arise that a suicide
5 bombing attack failed because the bomb didn't go off.
6 It was not something that was expected to happen.
7 Accordingly, and he accepts this, when the situation
8 of the 21/7 attacks presented itself, there was no
9 pre-prepared strategy to deal with it. That strategy
10 was evolved with some input from Mr Swain himself in the
11 series of meetings that took place on the 21st and into
12 the early hours of the morning of 22 July. That is the
13 strategy that would be used by the Metropolitan Police
14 in the unlikely event that a similar situation arose
15 again today. He considers that it is sound, and he says
16 that it is generally accepted as being sound.
17 Point 14, Mr Swain was asked about the criticisms
18 levelled by Mr Paddick at the strategy that was
19 developed. In general, he regards them as being based
20 on a lack of understanding, a lack of understanding of
21 the situation that was being dealt with. Mr Paddick's
22 experience in previous years with the Notting Hill
23 Carnival did not, in Mr Swain's view, enable him to
24 offer informed criticism in the context of a previously
25 unplanned, fast-moving and dynamic situation such as
88
1 that which obtained on 22 July.
2 The only point upon which he had some sympathy with
3 Mr Paddick was the suggestion that there should have
4 been a system of code words in use for the operation,
5 and in particular for the giving of an instruction to
6 take a critical shot. That's to say an order to use
7 lethal force.
8 However, as Mr Swain pointed out, there is nothing
9 unambiguous about the words "critical shot authorised",
10 and he would never have thought that the order "stop"
11 means "shoot". And in any event again, as no officer
12 that you have heard from ever considered that a critical
13 shot had been authorised so that the responsibility for
14 taking a decision remained fairly and squarely on the
15 frontline officers, you may conclude that Mr Paddick's
16 criticism, even if having some merit, is in no way of
17 significance in the circumstances which led to
18 Mr de Menezes' death.
19 Those are the points that Mr Swain made to you.
20 I am going to move on now from his evidence to summarise
21 other evidence about background events.
22 While London had been the subject of sporadic
23 terrorist attacks over a number of years before 2005,
24 mostly at the hands of the Provisional IRA, the four
25 suicide bomb attacks on 7 July were totally
89
1 unprecedented in the British experience of such matters.
2 You remember over 50 people died and hundreds of people
3 were injured.
4 Mr Peter Clarke -- who was, until he retired, the
5 Assistant Commissioner Special Operations and head of
6 the Anti-Terrorist Branch -- told you that Irish
7 terrorism was a totally different experience, because
8 the Irish terrorists were not intent on blowing
9 themselves up as well as any other persons who might
10 have been around, and they usually transmitted coded
11 warnings which would enable evacuations to take place.
12 The dangers presented by this new form of terrorism,
13 so far as Great Britain was concerned, presented
14 entirely new problems for the police in general and the
15 Metropolitan Police in particular.
16 The effect upon London of the 7/7 attacks was
17 extreme. In the two weeks after 7 July, the number of
18 calls from the public about suspected terrorist threats
19 rose from two to 104. Reports about suspect objects
20 rose from 215 to 2,406. The anti-terrorist hotline
21 received more than 3,900 calls in the fortnight between
22 7 and 21 July, while the number of extra days worked by
23 police officers over and above their normal policing
24 duties nearly doubled.
25 It became necessary to institute a system of 24-hour
90
1 oncall DSOs, and also to put into operation a filtering
2 system to ensure that they did not get swamped by the
3 deluge. The exercise by police officers of the power to
4 stop and search, which is vested in them by the
5 Home Secretary under the Terrorism Act, rose by a factor
6 of nearly four, and as Mr Clarke said, the fortnight
7 between 7 and 21 July was one of unprecedented intensity
8 in terms of policing activity, investigation,
9 expectation and fear of further attacks.
10 The assessment of the threat posed to the
11 United Kingdom from international terrorism was raised
12 for the first time to its very highest level, the level
13 being critical.
14 You will remember hearing some evidence from the
15 bystander witnesses who were on the train who gave
16 evidence about the state of nervous tension that existed
17 on the train on that morning, and I dare say you will
18 all be able to remember it for yourselves. There is no
19 reason to suppose, you may think, that police officers
20 who would be in the front line of defence of the threat
21 presented by suicide bombers would be otherwise than
22 similarly affected.
23 I come to the events of 21 July. On 21 July
24 terrorists attempted to explode bombs on three tube
25 trains, at the Oval, Shepherd's Bush and Warren Street
91
1 and on a bus in Hackney. Later, a fifth bomb was found
2 near Wormwood Scrubs prison. All the attempts were made
3 between 12.30 and 1.15 pm. Three of the bombers had
4 entered the tube system at Stockwell, a fact which
5 became known to the police quite soon, and which led
6 some on the following day to have a particular concern
7 about that station.
8 It was soon discovered that the devices were of
9 a very similar kind to those used on 7 July. Teams of
10 police were at the scene of each attempted attack very
11 soon afterwards, and it became apparent that the bombers
12 had left rucksacks containing the devices behind them.
13 But these could not be examined immediately. Monitoring
14 devices and the reactions of the bystanders led police
15 to be concerned that the devices might represent
16 a chemical or biological hazard, and in addition the
17 devices proved to contain highly unstable explosive
18 material. It was therefore necessary to have specialist
19 experts from the Ministry of Defence, as well as
20 explosives officers, brought to the scene.
21 Commander McDowall was the Deputy National
22 Co-ordinator for terrorist investigations, deputy to
23 Mr Clarke. You will remember that he was one of the
24 first witnesses, and he gave evidence by videolink. He
25 was on his way back to London from important meetings in
92
1 West Yorkshire when he received a phone call about the
2 attempted bombings. He took on the role of
3 Gold Commander for the investigations into these
4 attacks. You will recall that very broadly speaking,
5 the remit of a Gold Commander is to set the overall
6 strategy for an operation, but he still has some
7 continuing responsibility to oversee it.
8 The Silver Commander then decides on tactics to
9 implement that strategy, and Bronze Commanders then
10 command particular groups of police officers on the
11 ground.
12 I am now going to deal with you with the
13 chronological sequence of events which we can piece
14 together from the evidence of the witnesses, from the
15 contemporaneous documents, from the closed-circuit
16 television footage and from the telephone records. It's
17 only fair, only fair indeed, that I should acknowledge
18 the assistance I have had in this task from all the
19 interested persons, in particular the legal
20 representatives of the senior officers and the IPCC,
21 Independent Police Complaints Commission.
22 Mr McDowall arrived back at New Scotland Yard in the
23 early afternoon of the 21st, and began convening
24 meetings of senior officers. He decided that
25 Detective Superintendent Boutcher should be the senior
93
1 investigating officer for the proactive investigation
2 aimed at finding those who had attempted the bombings.
3 He decided that Detective Superintendent Prunty should
4 be in charge of the investigation of the scenes of the
5 attempted bombings.
6 Over the course of the afternoon, Mr McDowall was
7 involved in meetings with colleagues concerned with the
8 investigations into the 7 July bombings, and the
9 attempted attacks, and he had very many commitments on
10 his time.
11 Later in the afternoon, Mr Boutcher appointed
12 a deputy, Detective Chief Inspector Angela Scott, and
13 from then on they were directly responsible for the
14 manhunt to find the suicide bombers.
15 While that operation was going on, the police had to
16 have a separate group of officers manning an information
17 room at New Scotland Yard, and they were responsible for
18 receiving calls from the public about suspected
19 terrorist activity. Within those officers was
20 a designated senior officer in a small room called "the
21 bubble", who would be asked to take over if information
22 about a suspected suicide bomber came in from a member
23 of the public.
24 You were told by Mr Swain that a filtering system
25 had been introduced to prevent that DSO, the oncall DSO,
94
1 from being swamped with calls.
2 Just to remind you, the information room of course
3 is not room 1600. That is the information room at New
4 Scotland Yard. 1600 was the ops room for the operation
5 to track down the attempted suicide bombers.
6 At 5.15 on the 21st, Mr McDowall held a meeting of
7 the command team in the SO13 conference room.
8 A briefing was given by explosives officers about the
9 devices used in the failed attacks. They could not say
10 why the devices had not detonated, but they were able to
11 give a 90 per cent assessment that the devices were
12 peroxide-based, and this gave rise to immediate concerns
13 that there was a link with the 7 July attacks.
14 After this meeting, arrangements were made to ensure
15 that there were sufficient resources of firearms teams
16 from CO19, the firearms department. About half past 5
17 Mr Boutcher and Ms Scott met Inspector -- who has
18 a pseudonym -- ZAJ, who was the firearms tactical
19 adviser to Commander Carter, who was the DSO in the
20 bubble.
21 They asked ZAJ to ensure that specialist firearms
22 teams were in place for possible deployment 24 hours
23 a day. It was envisaged that there would be one team on
24 duty overnight and later, as the investigation went on,
25 there would be two early turn firearms teams and two
95
1 late turn teams.
2 After that meeting, Inspector ZAJ passed on the
3 request to Andrew, a Chief Inspector in the firearms
4 department who was the night duty tactical adviser, and
5 it was his general responsibility to ensure that proper
6 arrangements were made overnight to provide firearms
7 teams for operations which might need them.
8 He recorded ZAJ's request in the CO19 operation
9 policy log and recorded that the oncall night duty
10 firearms team would be the orange team under its leader,
11 Alpha 1.
12 At 6 o'clock that evening, Mr McDowall briefed
13 a group of about 100 officers on the events of the
14 afternoon. At 6.15, there was a further meeting of the
15 command team under Mr McDowall. He says that he wanted
16 to ensure that the scenes were being examined with
17 fingertip precision and that thorough attempts were
18 being made to find witnesses. Also by this time
19 Mr McDowall had identified the operations room on the
20 16th floor of New Scotland Yard as the appropriate room
21 from which to run the manhunt for the suspected bombers.
22 He told you that he chose it because it was well
23 connected to the Cougar radio system, and because it had
24 a linked intelligence cell which could be used to bring
25 in intelligence from other parts of the police, from the
96
1 security services, and so on; and to assist in the
2 manhunt Mr McDowall ordered an intensive trawl of
3 closed-circuit television footage from the stations
4 where the bomb attacks had been attempted, the purpose
5 being to obtain photographs of the attempted bombers.
6 Over the course of these meetings in the late
7 afternoon, Mr McDowall asked that steps be taken to
8 ensure that there were sufficient surveillance and
9 firearms officers available for operations which might
10 have to be mounted as intelligence came in. As the
11 evening went on, he had further meetings. Consideration
12 began to be given to a possible media appeal, calling on
13 the public to help find the bombers.
14 At 8.15, Mr McDowall saw Superintendent -- as he
15 then was -- Mr Swain. He discussed the possibility of
16 having to use the tactics developed under
17 Operation Kratos. It was only by 9 o'clock that evening
18 that the experts at the various tube stations had
19 completed their assessment of the devices and regarded
20 it as safe for scene examiners to look at the bomb bags,
21 and the careful process then began of opening the bags
22 and taking photographs of their contents. This process
23 took some hours.
24 Shortly after 10 o'clock, Mr McDowall had a meeting
25 of the command team. Commander Carter, the oncall DSO,
97
1 Mr Boutcher, Mr Prunty and Ms Scott were there. From
2 CO19, Inspector ZAJ was there, as was Andrew. As I have
3 mentioned, Andrew had already recorded that the orange
4 firearms team were to be the night duty team of
5 specialist firearms officers. He had also given
6 authority for firearms teams involved in the manhunt to
7 use hollow point ammunition which was considered
8 particularly suitable for incapacitating a target while
9 causing the least collateral damage to those around.
10 Also at the 10 o'clock meeting was Detective Chief
11 Inspector Noel Baker, a senior officer from
12 Special Branch, who was to be the co-ordinator of the
13 16th floor operations room overnight.
14 At this meeting, the senior officers discussed
15 whether or not there should be a media appeal. By the
16 end of the meeting, this overt strategy seemed to be
17 favoured, probably because at that stage no information
18 had come in giving the names or much less the addresses
19 of the suspected bombers. It was decided that firearms
20 authorisation would be required on a contingency basis,
21 so that CO19 firearms officers could be deployed in
22 armed teams at short notice. There was a preliminary
23 discussion about the possibility of appointing
24 a designated senior officer, DSO, specifically for the
25 manhunt. As you have heard, this was a novel suggestion
98
1 for an intelligence-led operation.
2 Following on from that meeting, at 10 to midnight,
3 11.50, Detective Chief Superintendent White of CO19
4 orally gave authority for the use of firearms by
5 officers of that department. Just before midnight,
6 Andrew, the night duty firearms tactical adviser, gave
7 to Mr Boutcher a tactical options document which he and
8 Chief Inspector Esposito had produced the previous day.
9 It dealt with a number of different possible
10 scenarios, one of which involved interception of
11 a suicide bomber on foot. The advisers gave a range of
12 tactical options for dealing with that scenario, some
13 involving a stop, some involving containment and
14 challenge. They set out the types of firearms officers
15 who could be used for the various options, and in the
16 document they acknowledged that if officers faced
17 a person who was believed to be a suicide bomber with
18 a bomb, they would have to consider whether ordinary
19 conventional firearms tactics could be used.
20 Past midnight, 22 July. Shortly after 1 o'clock on
21 22 July, there was a meeting at a hotel near New
22 Scotland Yard, the purpose of which was to decide on
23 appointing a DSO for the manhunt. Mr Boutcher and
24 Ms Scott consulted with Commanders Allison and Carter.
25 Mr Swain and Andrew were there as well. They agreed
99
1 that a DSO should be appointed, and they settled on
2 Commander Dick as she then was. She was particularly
3 experienced in the role, having been one of the first
4 senior officers to receive training to be a DSO for
5 Operation Kratos situations.
6 When she gave evidence, she dealt with the career
7 experience she had which made her particularly suitable
8 for that role. A call was made to her at around
9 1.30 am, when she was asked to arrive at Scotland Yard
10 by 7 o'clock that morning.
11 Andrew recorded his work in an operational policy
12 log. After the meeting at the hotel, he recorded in the
13 log that two photographs of suspects were to be released
14 as part of a media appeal, and that there might be,
15 accordingly, a need for two firearms teams to deploy
16 simultaneously. He recorded that the grey team was
17 nearing the end of its duty and was to bed down in
18 a hotel until 10 o'clock on the morning of the 22nd. He
19 also recorded that Ms Scott was to be the night duty
20 Silver.
21 At 2 o'clock in the morning, Mr McDowall left New
22 Scotland Yard to go to a nearby hotel for some rest.
23 His loggist, a Detective Inspector Forteath, remained at
24 New Scotland Yard. By that time, it still seemed likely
25 that a media appeal would take place. Ms Scott also
100
1 left for a short break at about 2 o'clock in the
2 morning, and Mr Boutcher left at about 2.30.
3 While they were away, the operations room on the
4 16th floor was under the control of Detective Chief
5 Inspector Noel Baker of Special Branch, and Andrew of
6 CO19 was also in the room at times.
7 However, criticism has been made of the fact that
8 Mr Boutcher and his deputy were both away from New
9 Scotland Yard at the same time, and there was nobody
10 formally nominated as Silver Commander for the manhunt
11 while they were away.
12 Be that as it may, the investigation continued. At
13 around five past 2, just after Mr McDowall had left,
14 information came in from those examining the rucksack at
15 Shepherd's Bush to Mr Macbrayne, who was a senior
16 officer in SO13, the anti-terrorist squad. The
17 information was that a gym card had been found in the
18 name of Hussain Osman, and that the card bore
19 a photograph of that man. According to the records kept
20 by Mr Forteath, the loggist, he received the information
21 about Osman at about 2.15 in the morning. Mr Macbrayne
22 also discussed this new information with
23 Detective Chief Inspector Mellody, who is
24 a Special Branch officer with responsibility for
25 intelligence.
101
1 Police enquiries then turned to the gym, and
2 officers tracked down the keyholder of the gym in order
3 to get access to its records. They were at the gym by
4 3 o'clock in the morning, and had recovered duplicate
5 membership cards held at the gym. This showed that the
6 membership was jointly held by Hussain Osman and
7 Abdi Omar, who had both given as their address
8 21 Scotia Road in the Tulse Hill area.
9 The duplicate cards had photographs of both the men,
10 and these were taken back to New Scotland Yard. The
11 police now had photographs of the two men, taken from
12 the gym membership cards, but did not know when those
13 photographs had been taken.
14 All the time that these enquiries were going on,
15 police officers at the scenes of the various attempted
16 bombings were continuing to photograph the contents of
17 the bags. Those at the Shepherd's Bush scene were
18 photographing some torn up photographs which had been in
19 the rucksack and which showed a man and a woman. These
20 have been called the wedding photos and we now know that
21 they show Mr Osman and his wife, Yeshiembet Girma.
22 At about ten past 3 one of the officers at the scene
23 told Mr Macbrayne that the man in the wedding
24 photographs was the same as the man on the gym card
25 photograph. Mr Macbrayne told you that a decision was
102
1 taken not to forward on the wedding photographs to New
2 Scotland Yard because they might be an important source
3 of fingerprint and DNA evidence and because a photograph
4 from the gym card had already been sent through. Of
5 course, a photograph of the wedding photographs could
6 have been sent through.
7 At 4 o'clock in the morning, Mr McDowall returned to
8 New Scotland Yard, and his loggist, Mr Forteath, went
9 off duty. At around this time, Mr McDowall and other
10 officers were able to compare the photographs taken from
11 the gym with closed-circuit television stills which had
12 been obtained from the various scenes of the attempted
13 bombings.
14 It was concluded that Hussain Osman was a good
15 likeness for the man shown attempting to detonate
16 a device at Shepherd's Bush.
17 On that score, they were right; he was
18 Hussain Osman, the failed bomber.
19 They concluded that Abdi Omar was a good likeness
20 for the Warren Street suspect shown on CCTV stills from
21 that station. They were wrong about that. Abdi Omar
22 was, so far as we can tell, entirely innocent in
23 relation to these attacks.
24 Therefore, by the time that Mr McDowall was back,
25 the situation had changed dramatically. The police now
103
1 had two names, photographs associated with those names,
2 closed-circuit television stills, and an address,
3 21 Scotia Road.
4 It is 3 o'clock, I could do with a break and I dare
5 say you could too.
6 (3.05 pm)

8 (3.20 pm)
9 (In the presence of the jury)
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I had just got to the establishment of
11 the names and addresses. We are now down to 4 o'clock
12 in the morning. Very shortly after 4 o'clock in the
13 morning, instructions were given to research
14 intelligence on Hussain Osman. Those researches were to
15 reveal that he had been stopped by police on a driving
16 matter. Officers were told to contact the driving
17 licensing authorities and the immigration authorities to
18 obtain photographs and other information about him.
19 However, it appears that the DVLA photographs did not
20 come through until about midday on the 22nd, and that of
21 course was after the shooting in Stockwell, and the
22 immigration authority's photographs came through later
23 in the afternoon.
24 Detective Chief Inspector Southworth explained how
25 these things work and that it can take some hours to get
104
1 such photographs or intelligence from those sources.
2 I did, you may remember, ask him what the
3 accessibility was of the DVLA for such enquiries, and he
4 said, well, we can only access them in office hours.
5 That, as it happens, has turned out to be wrong. Having
6 told you that you are not going to hear any more
7 evidence, you now are. But that is a statement that
8 came in before the guillotine came down, and this is the
9 most convenient moment to tell you what it is.
10 I am going to read to you extracts, what we need,
11 anyway, from a witness statement of Martin Edwards, who
12 is a police officer working within the
13 Metropolitan Police intelligence bureau. He says that:
14 "Any enquiries made to the DVLA have to be made
15 through a DVLA liaison officer, of which I am one of two
16 such officers. In 2005 this would have included checks
17 with the DVLA for terrorism. DVLA will only deal in the
18 first instance with authorised liaison officers. I make
19 this statement in relation to the call-out procedure
20 operated by DVLA for out-of-hours requests from police.
21 This call-out procedure has been in operation since
22 1985. The call-out procedure in 2005 is the identical
23 procedure as is used today. DVLA hours of operation are
24 8.15 am to 4.30 pm Monday to Friday. DVLA do not
25 operate 24 hours a day."
