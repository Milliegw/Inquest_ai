2 (In the presence of the jury)
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, again, 4.30 I think is probably
4 enough for a full day's work, and I'm going to send you
5 home again tonight, again as I said last night, with all
6 the usual warnings.
7 I am in your hands. Would you find it useful to
8 start at 9.30 tomorrow or would you prefer 10?
9 THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY: We were wondering if we could
10 start at 9.30? I think that would help.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well, 9.30 tomorrow. Thank you
12 very much.
