5 (In the presence of the jury)
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
7 All I can say is I hope you enjoyed the weekend. All
8 I have to ask you to do, please, when the jury bailiffs
9 have been re-sworn, is to retire again and continue with
10 your deliberations.
11 (Jury bailiffs re-sworn)
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you. Off you go, ladies and
13 gentlemen.
14 (10.12 am)
15 (The jury retire)
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I take it there are no matters arising?
17 No. Very well; thank you all.
18 (10.13 am)
19 (Court rise)
20 (3.06 pm)
21 (In the presence of the jury)
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I hope whoever's throat it is is
23 holding up all right. I do not want to overdo you, if
24 one of you is not too well, so we will break off now and
25 I would be glad if you could be back here again at
2
1 10 o'clock tomorrow morning to continue.
2 Again can I simply repeat, at the risk of boring
3 you, that the same advice and direction that I gave you
4 on Friday afternoon remains: no private investigations,
5 no checking with anybody else, no talking to anybody
6 else or letting anybody talk to you.
7 I dare say you know that our occupation at the Oval
8 will come to an end this coming Friday, on the 12th.
9 That doesn't mean that there is any problem as far as
10 you are concerned or pressure of time. If, by Friday,
11 you have not been able to arrive at verdicts or the
12 answers to the questions, I have made arrangements that
13 we shall be accommodated at Southwark Crown Court for as
14 long as we need so that, for the time being of course,
15 its still here, this week; but next week, if necessary,
16 it'll be in Southwark Crown Court.
17 If you'd like to break off now and come back at
18 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.
19 (3.10 pm)
20 (In the absence of the jury)
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you all very much.
