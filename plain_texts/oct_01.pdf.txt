2 (10.00 am)
3 (In the absence of the jury)
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, Mr Stern?
5 MR STERN: Sir, may I just mention one matter briefly in
6 relation to questioning of Andrew on Monday? Can I say
7 first of all, I am acutely aware of the time constraints
8 that we are under, and I am acutely aware of the
9 difficulties that places on you. Let me say that
10 straightaway.
11 I am concerned, though, about a couple of points
12 that, sir, were raised by you which, if I may say so,
13 with great respect, are not entirely accurate factually.
14 They come at page 181. Sir, it's a very short point.
15 I know Mr Hilliard will have the page.
16 Sir, you indicated to the jury through me,
17 obviously, that C2 and C12 were not even there at the
18 early stage. The second matter is that their
19 involvement did not start until they got to Stockwell
20 station.
21 Now, the significance of that, playing back, if
22 I may, Mr Mansfield's cross-examination or questioning,
23 perhaps I should say, is his assertion as I started the
24 questions of Andrew, was this:
25 "So it's clear to you why I am asking these
2
1 questions, what I am wanting to demonstrate is that had
2 an orange team with all the right structures actually
3 gone to Scotia Road at a much earlier time and been
4 there at 9.34, it's a possibility..."
5 You know what he said thereafter: that it wouldn't
6 have happened. That is an assertion that is not
7 accepted and it's important that that fact is not set
8 out as a fact before the jury at this stage. That is
9 the matter that I was trying to deal with. I am sorry
10 if I didn't explain it properly on Monday.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes. I remind you that at, I think it
12 was the second pre-inquest review, the one that
13 I presided over the first time, I hoped I had made it
14 clear that while I was perfectly amenable to everybody
15 asking questions of an opinionative nature to those
16 senior police officers who might be reasonably regarded
17 as specialists or experts in their field, I didn't
18 expect, as it were, the rank and file to be asked to
19 offer their views about everybody. I appreciate about
20 Andrew. That's the first point.
21 The second point, of course, is that the firearms
22 officers, for reasons which I am quite sure are
23 absolutely sensible and admirable, have elected to be
24 separately represented as to the two groups. That's
25 fine but it merely means that the interests that are to
3
1 be protected by each group are different, and in your
2 case, to be blunt, in my view are much narrower because
3 of the limits on their personal involvement.
4 MR STERN: I completely understand that, but may I say first
5 of all that this cause, as you told the jury at the
6 outset --
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Forgive me one moment, just thinking
8 about what you said to me a moment ago, I understand the
9 point you are making about whether or not a team, some
10 team, could have intervened at Scotia Road long before
11 anything else had developed. But that, surely, is to
12 be -- first of all it's questions into which the senior
13 officers, the planners, are interested. I am not
14 decrying C2 and C12's personal qualities, but they were
15 effectively the front line soldiers.
16 MR STERN: You are absolutely right, sir, but let me say
17 that straightaway, and I take your point entirely that
18 on a very narrow interpretation, I do not have a brief
19 to ask the questions beyond those that you have set out.
20 But this is, of course, an inquisitorial nature inquest,
21 and you can be assured that Ms Leek and I will not
22 duplicate questions because we have obviously discussed
23 matters and ensure that we don't do that.
24 There are certain things at which she is abundantly
25 more talented than me in dealing with, which is most of
4
1 the case, but in relation to the small part of firearms
2 tactics, I have obviously the ear of those officers who
3 were present at the scene.
4 Now, it's important that somebody, and I don't mind
5 who it is, but somebody deals with these issues. Sir,
6 you took up the very issue that you curtailed my
7 questioning on, and asked Andrew at the end that very
8 matter because you wanted to deal --
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's because at the end of the day,
10 what questions are and are not asked are a matter for
11 me.
12 MR STERN: I appreciate that.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I was dealing with other people's
14 interests at that stage. Mr Stern, let us not labour
15 this.
16 MR STERN: No, I do not want to do that at all.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I am wholly unrepentant.
18 MR STERN: Without wishing to be discourteous it may be --
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: If I have distressed you by curtailing
20 your cross-examination, I apologise. That doesn't mean
21 to say I will not do it again, not necessarily with you.
22 MR STERN: It isn't the first time and it won't be the last,
23 I am absolutely sure.
24 I do want to address this particular issue because
25 it comes to this, and if I can just explain in
5
1 a sentence what it is. The essential element is this:
2 that the only viable stopping place of Mr de Menezes, as
3 it turned out, it would seem, was between him getting
4 off the bus at Stockwell and going into the tube.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I doubt that very much.
6 MR STERN: Well, that is what I was going to deal with, with
7 Andrew, who is an independent firearms tactical adviser.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I don't think you need to be too
9 worried. You are certainly going to have Mr Tillbrook
10 and Mr Swain to deal with this.
11 MR STERN: Neither of them are firearms officers.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: One is a training --
13 MR STERN: Neither of them are specialist firearms officers.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Forgive me, we have somebody, I may
15 have forgotten the name --
16 MR STERN: They deal with the training, that's absolutely
17 right but they are not tactical advisers, and that is
18 precisely why I wanted to deal with it through Andrew.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Do you want to have him back?
20 MR STERN: T84 and obviously T80 --
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, they are also tactical firearms
22 officers.
23 MR STERN: They are, but they are witnesses of fact and that
24 is why I wanted to deal with it through Andrew.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: So I thought was Andrew.
6
1 MR STERN: Mr Mansfield expanded it and I reacted to that.
2 I just mention that.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Does anybody else want to make any
4 observations about this before I ask Mr Hilliard?
5 Mr Hilliard.
6 MR HILLIARD: Sir, I was going to say this: there is a short
7 point to this which is that what you indicated, looking
8 at the transcript, was that Mr Stern's questions should
9 be directed towards the interests of those individuals
10 who he represents; and you said that there were plenty
11 of others to deal with this question of intervention at
12 the different stages. As you have indicated, C2 and C12
13 are separately represented from the other firearms
14 officers, and on the face of it there have to be some
15 consequences that flow from that. Neither Ms Leek nor
16 Mr Perry sought to deal with this topic and they perhaps
17 wouldn't have faced the same hurdle that Mr Stern did.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I think that's right. Thank you,
19 Mr Hilliard.
20 As I have just indicated to Mr Stern, who has raised
21 his objection with, if I may say so, his usual courtesy,
22 it seems to me that the questions that he was asking of
23 Andrew, insofar as they related to C2 and C12, was not
24 dissimilar to counsel acting for two private soldiers in
25 the trenches in 1916 to offer criticism of
7
1 General Haig's plan of attack, which for those who have
2 read Siegfried Sassoon will know did for them.
3 I adhere entirely to the view I expressed to
4 Mr Stern. I remind myself and everybody else here that
5 what questions are and are not to be asked by individual
6 counsel in relation to the interests of the interested
7 parties whom they represent are a matter for me and
8 I will seek, so far as I can, to ask people to confine
9 themselves to the issues that they have to relate to,
10 that they have to deal with. I don't doubt, as this
11 inquest goes on, that I shall be in conflict with
12 counsel -- I hope not too often or not too crossly -- on
13 the same issue again and again. But as long as the
14 controversy is dealt with in the amicable way that
15 Mr Stern and I have dealt with it, I don't really think
16 I shall have any complaints and I hope he has not
17 either.
18 MR STERN: None at all, sir.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well, can we have the jury back?
20 MR HILLIARD: Please. Thank you. (Pause)
21 (In the presence of the jury)
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
23 Sorry to keep you waiting. There was a matter of law
24 that I had to discuss with counsel. As I told you at
25 the outset, I might be sending you out for matters like
8
1 that. The main reason is that so counsel and I can
2 address each other freely without too much eavesdropping
3 from the interested ranks of the jury box. However, we
4 are ready to go on now.
5 Yes, Mr Hough.
6 MR HOUGH: The witness today is Mr Boutcher.
7 DETECTIVE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT JON BOUTCHER (sworn)
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you, Mr Boutcher. Please sit
9 down.
10 A. Thank you, sir.
11 Questions from MR HOUGH
12 MR HOUGH: Could you give your name and rank to the court,
13 please.
14 A. Yes, sir, it's Jon Boutcher, Detective Chief
15 Superintendent attached to the Counter-Terrorism Command
16 at Scotland Yard.
17 Q. My name is Jonathan Hough. I'll ask you questions first
18 on behalf of the Coroner and then you will be asked
19 questions by interested persons.
20 A. Good morning, sir.
21 Q. In July 2005, what rank did you hold?
22 A. I was Detective Superintendent, sir.
23 Q. Were you then in the SO13 Anti-Terrorist Branch?
24 A. That's correct, sir, yes, I was.
25 Q. Had you been working in that branch since November of
9
1 2003?
2 A. Yes, sir.
3 Q. I think you were actually on secondment but it was
4 a rather long secondment?
5 A. No, it was a placement there, sir.
6 Q. I think you had previously been posted, is this right,
7 in the National Crime Squad?
8 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
9 Q. And in the Flying Squad?
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 Q. Part of the Serious Crime Directorate which deals with
12 armed robberies and similar offences?
13 A. Serious and organised crime, yes, sir.
14 Q. In those postings had you been trained as a firearms
15 officer?
16 A. I had on the National Crime Squad and the Flying Squad,
17 yes, sir.
18 Q. Had you performed the role of Silver Commander many
19 times?
20 A. I had, sir, yes.
21 Q. Both in a control room and on the ground?
22 A. Yes, sir.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: To what level had you been trained as
24 a firearms officer, Mr Boutcher, specialist firearms
25 officer?
10
1 A. It's slightly different on the National Crime Squad,
2 sir. We deal with armed interventions. So not the
3 level of specialist firearms officer, but dealing with
4 MP5s, machine guns, automatic handguns, and to do armed
5 interventions, arrests, if you like crime in action type
6 of style of arrests.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
8 MR HOUGH: After the attacks on 7 July 2005, I think you
9 were appointed as senior investigating officer for the
10 proactive investigation?
11 A. That's correct, yes, sir.
12 Q. Does that mean you were in general managerial
13 responsibility of the operation to find those
14 responsible?
15 A. Yes, that's correct, sir. My responsibility was to
16 identify and locate those responsible for the attacks on
17 7/7 and 21/7.
18 Q. Now, we will get to the detail of how you were
19 appointed, but is this right, from 21 July you performed
20 the same role in respect of the attempted attacks on
21 that day?
22 A. I did, sir, yes.
23 Q. So is this right, on the 21st you had both those
24 responsibilities?
25 A. Yes, sir. If I could just expand on that. Colleagues
11
1 were appointed, senior investigating officer roles for
2 the 7 July attacks dealing with the reactive
3 investigation, the collection of evidence from the
4 scenes, which was obviously an enormous responsibility
5 and investigation. And my responsibility from 7 July
6 was to deal with the key and high priority leads to
7 identify those responsible for the event, and similarly
8 with 21 July.
9 Q. Yes. We have heard about at least one of the people
10 appointed in the reactive investigation, that is to say
11 finding evidence at the scene and communicating that
12 evidence to those at Scotland Yard?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. I think you made three significant records of what went
15 on on 21 and 22 July, and if I can just go through them.
16 First of all, in time, there is your red book, and we
17 have heard about that kind of document, sketchy
18 handwritten notes made by you of things that you were
19 doing or had to do?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. I think you have got your red book with you?
22 A. I have, sir, yes.
23 Q. Second in time, I think you made a tape recording on the
24 evening of 23 July, which has been transcribed?
25 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
12
1 Q. That focused on events on the 21st and 22nd?
2 A. Yes, it did, sir.
3 Q. Then third in time, there is an electronic running log
4 of the operation, the relevant section of which was,
5 I think, completed by you on 2 August 2005?
6 A. If I could just explain that, sir, there is
7 an electronic log. It was finalised on 2 August when
8 I signed the original as it being completed, but it was
9 a document that existed from the 21st, and I'm adding to
10 it throughout that period.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes. Was it exclusive to you or was it
12 being contributed to by other officers?
13 A. No, sir, the document has a reference section for those
14 who are inputting a particular part of the document. So
15 it identifies --
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: So it's a composite effort?
17 A. Yes, sir.
18 MR HOUGH: When I need to show you elements of -- to entries
19 in those different records, I will ask them to be put on
20 screen.
21 A. Certainly.
22 Q. That's for speed. So that in case others want to direct
23 the jury to hard copies, and because they are important
24 documents, we are going to have them handed to the jury
25 now. These will all go into tab 44 of the bundle, and
13
1 first of all into tab 44 if you put in what's being
2 handed to you first, which is the transcript of the tape
3 recording. (Handed)
4 Just to be clear on this, Mr Boutcher, when the jury
5 come to look at this, it's dated at the bottom
6 16 November 2005. I think that's just the date you
7 authenticated the transcript?
8 A. That would be correct, sir, yes.
9 Q. You actually made the recording just a couple of days
10 after the events?
11 A. The following day, sir, yes.
12 Q. The next thing I am asking to be handed up is a copy of
13 the log, and the jury will be able to see the pages of
14 that because each page has the word "secret" at the top.
15 (Handed)
16 That goes into tab 44 immediately after the
17 transcript. Then finally, a smaller document, a set of
18 handwritten notes with the word "Vivace" on the top. If
19 that can go in as the third part of tab 44, and that's
20 the entry from your red book that you were jotting on
21 the day?
22 A. Yes, sir. (Handed)
23 Q. As I say, I'll have entries put up on screen so that the
24 jury don't need to flick through those while we are
25 going along, but what I will ask you to have to hand is
14
1 a statement which you made, I think, on
2 16 November 2005.
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. Do you have that there with you?
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 Q. Can I begin with the period from 7 July to 21 July? Is
7 this right, over that period, you were pursuing leads
8 from the investigation into the 7 July bombings?
9 A. Yes, sir.
10 Q. In the course of that, I think you sometimes had to
11 deploy both firearms teams and surveillance teams?
12 A. Yes, sir, that's correct.
13 Q. And also other assets, some of which may be secret?
14 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
15 Q. I think that also involved working with a range of
16 agencies both within and outside the
17 Metropolitan Police?
18 A. Yes, sir.
19 Q. Over that period, were you initially using a suite in
20 New Scotland Yard called the C3000 suite?
21 A. Not continually, sir, for part of the period, for part
22 of the operation, we did use that suite, but not
23 continually.
24 Q. Did a time come when you stopped using that suite?
25 A. We used it, sir, if I could explain, to resolve
15
1 a particular line of inquiry at some premises in London,
2 to control them with armed surveillance and a specialist
3 firearms team at that location.
4 Q. Did a time come when you decided to use the 16th floor
5 operations room?
6 A. For future deployments, yes, sir.
7 Q. Did you perform an exercise to test the suitability of
8 that room?
9 A. If I can explain again, sir, between the periods of the
10 7th and the 21st, I convened a number of stakeholders
11 together, both from within the Metropolitan Police and
12 outside, partner agencies, to test interoperability,
13 radio communications, chain of command. And an exercise
14 was devised and it was run on my behalf or following my
15 request by Superintendent Connell from Special Branch
16 and it was run on 15 July.
17 Q. Was that operation called Operation CATTO, C-A-T-T-O?
18 A. I believe it was, sir, yes.
19 Q. Was that exercise both to test the interrelation between
20 the police and other agencies, other
21 intelligence-gathering agencies?
22 A. Other intelligence-gathering agencies and other partner
23 agencies working in terrorism as well, sir.
24 Q. In the course of that, did you also test such matters as
25 the use of the 16th floor room and also the connection
16
1 of the DSO, designated senior officer position, with
2 other agencies?
3 A. I wasn't there on the date, on the 15th, sir. I would
4 need to look at documents to establish that, I am
5 afraid.
6 Q. Are you aware, did that exercise throw up any
7 difficulties?
8 A. I have subsequently read a debriefing document, and some
9 issues were identified from that with regards to, you
10 know, learning and improving, sir, certainly.
11 Q. Did it throw up any concerns about the 16th floor room?
12 A. I think we are always looking to improve, sir, so there
13 were some issues in the document which I would need to
14 look at to refresh my memory, but I think there were
15 some issues identified, yes.
16 Q. Could we have D07797 on screen, please.
17 Do you recognise this as one of the debrief
18 documents?
19 A. I do, sir, yes.
20 Q. I am just going to read from the section "Operations
21 Room":
22 "It was generally agreed that the increased number
23 of personnel coupled with the numerous
24 visitors/observers added to the already chaotic initial
25 environment. The increased sound level generated by
17
1 this and the radio traffic, see comms, also contributed
2 to the sometimes confusing picture. It was also
3 mentioned that by perhaps grouping agency units together
4 per subject, it would have been easier to quickly
5 establish a clearer picture."
6 Then there is a discussion about assigning
7 designated seats and so on.
8 A. Yes, sir.
9 Q. Can you explain what that concern related to?
10 A. I wasn't there at the time, sir. That was Mr Connell.
11 It was some three years ago. Superintendent Connell was
12 responsible for the debrief document, the learning
13 document, and he was there on the events of 21 and
14 22 July to ensure that any best practice that had been
15 identified could be adopted for the operation we
16 conducted on the 21st.
17 Q. So any concern like that had been identified and was
18 being taken into account on the 21st and 22nd?
19 A. Through Mr Connell, sir, yes.
20 Q. I think that can be taken off screen now.
21 Now, moving on to 21 July, were you in New Scotland
22 Yard when information was coming in about the attempted
23 bombings?
24 A. I was, sir, yes.
25 Q. I won't give you the times of all of them, but the first
18
1 we know is timed at 12.36 and the last at 11 minutes
2 past 1 in the afternoon?
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. Did you immediately note similarities with the 7/7
5 bombings?
6 A. I did, sir, yes.
7 Q. What were those similarities, the obvious ones?
8 A. The obvious ones, because the locations, transport,
9 infrastructure being attacked and the actual devices,
10 hydrogen peroxide devices which we had only seen
11 previously on 7 July.
12 Q. During the afternoon, in your statement -- I am at
13 paragraph 7 -- you say that you were tasked by
14 Commander McDowall to "prepare a proactive capability as
15 a contingency should those responsible be identified"?
16 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
17 Q. Can you expand on the meaning of that, what were you to
18 do?
19 A. That was for me to prepare and continge a proactive
20 capability which involved such things as surveillance,
21 as a firearms response, as a control room capability
22 being staffed, technical support assets so that we could
23 try to deploy sensitive means to obtain intelligence,
24 and to have a command structure for that.
25 Q. Could we have on screen, please, document page 240.
19
1 Now, this is the first page, relevant page, of your red
2 book?
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. We see at the top of that the various locations of the
5 attempted bombings being noted?
6 A. Yes, sir.
7 Q. Then towards the bottom, do we see the words "things to
8 do" just above the word "McDale" or "McDaid"?
9 A. Oh, yes, sir, sorry.
10 Q. "Things to do". Then underneath that, do you see the
11 acronyms, "SCD11"?
12 A. Yes, sir.
13 Q. Is that a division of the Serious Crime Directorate?
14 A. That's the surveillance element, sir.
15 Q. Then SO19?
16 A. Yes, sir.
17 Q. So SCD11 is another source of surveillance teams other
18 than SO12 Special Branch?
19 A. Yes, sir, that's correct.
20 Q. So are you there recording that you need to do something
21 about having sufficient resources of SCD11, surveillance
22 teams, and CO19 firearms teams?
23 A. Yes, sir, and next to that is Joe Connell, the
24 superintendent that I asked to assist me in arranging
25 those assets.
20
1 Q. That can come off screen now. Roughly what time of the
2 day did you have the discussion with
3 Superintendent Connell?
4 A. It was some three years ago now. I couldn't be precise,
5 I am afraid, sir, but during the evening I think I spoke
6 to him on a number of occasions.
7 Q. Did you also speak to somebody separate in the CO19
8 firearms division?
9 A. I did, sir, yes.
10 Q. Who was that? Well, in fairness, I should tell you he
11 has been anonymised so if you don't know his anonymous
12 name, I can give you a prompt.
13 A. I believe I do. Perhaps you could prompt me, sir.
14 Q. He may be Inspector ZAJ?
15 A. Yes, sir. Yes.
16 Q. Was he the oncall CO19 tactical adviser at the time you
17 spoke to him?
18 A. Yes, sir, he was.
19 Q. And therefore responsible for arranging resources?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. Did you see him in the CO19 reserve room?
22 A. No, sir. I contacted the reserve room at CO19 and he
23 attended Scotland Yard.
24 Q. What did you ask of him?
25 A. Obviously I basically explained the situation and that
21
1 we would require a firearms capability, both overnight
2 and as an emergency contingency and for the following
3 day, and indeed for the longer term for the likely
4 deployments over a period of time from that point.
5 Q. So we have you speaking to Superintendent Connell to
6 arrange surveillance, and Inspector ZAJ to arrange
7 firearms cover?
8 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
9 Q. And all on a contingency basis?
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 Q. Did you also ask for the operations room to be opened
12 and staffed?
13 A. I did, sir, yes.
14 Q. Perhaps we can have page 231 of the documents on screen.
15 This is another page from your red book, I think.
16 It's part of the tape transcript. At the very
17 bottom of the page, do you see these words:
18 "I similarly had a conversation with
19 Superintendent Connell. Superintendent Connell also
20 undertook to open the 16th floor operations room of
21 SO12."
22 A. Yes, sir, that's correct.
23 Q. So did you arrange the opening of that room through
24 Superintendent Connell?
25 A. I did, sir, yes.
22
1 Q. Now, again, if that can be taken off screen, and on the
2 screen perhaps page 242. This is a page from your red
3 book. Towards the bottom of that page, do we see the
4 words:
5 "Six teams, four times SCD11 teams, two times SO12".
6 A. That's correct, sir. As I said, the SCD11 is the
7 surveillance element from the Serious Crime Directorate,
8 and the two SO12 teams are surveillance teams and that's
9 for the next morning, so we have got six surveillance
10 teams available from the next day.
11 Q. From what time the next day?
12 A. 7 am, sir.
13 Q. So those are the surveillance resources you will have
14 from 7 am on 22 July?
15 A. Yes, sir.
16 Q. Then two lines down:
17 "2/3 SO12".
18 What does that mean?
19 A. That was -- I was told by Mr Connell we had sort of two
20 to three SO12 in numbers, surveillance teams available
21 to cover the overnight contingency.
22 Q. So we have you during the afternoon and evening
23 arranging cover for surveillance, and two to three teams
24 overnight, six teams coming onstream in the morning?
25 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
23
1 Q. Then a few lines down, "SO19". What does that refer to?
2 A. Again, the requirement to contact SO19 to arrange
3 coverage as well, sir.
4 Q. Then "ops room" with a tick by that. Is that
5 a reference to opening the operations room?
6 A. I believe so, sir, yes.
7 Q. Again that can be taken off screen. Did you also make
8 contact with the technical support unit of the
9 Serious Crime Directorate to ensure that they prepared
10 any assets they might have?
11 A. Yes, it was to make contact with a detective inspector
12 again for the nights, and a detective inspector for the
13 day shift to enable us to deploy again sensitive
14 techniques to obtain intelligence.
15 Q. Inspector ZAJ, did you expect that he would remain at
16 Scotland Yard for a period of time, or did you expect
17 him to leave at some particular point?
18 A. From my recollection, sir, following speaking to
19 Inspector ZAJ, a further tactical adviser, who -- I know
20 Inspector ZAJ and a further tactical adviser who
21 I believe is Andrew.
22 Q. Andrew, yes?
23 A. Andrew came to Scotland Yard to be the senior tactical
24 adviser in the operations room for that night shift.
25 Q. So as far as you knew, at the time, it was going to be
24
1 ZAJ, then Andrew responsible for arranging the resources
2 which you knew you needed?
3 A. I think, sir, my understanding was that I had spoken to
4 Inspector ZAJ and his senior officer, the Chief
5 Inspector Andrew, then came to speak to me because of
6 the seriousness, to actually be the specific point of
7 contact for arranging the firearms overnight.
8 Q. I'll try to do this without showing you a record for
9 fear of breaching anonymity of one witness.
10 Did you establish that afternoon and evening the
11 need for a structure of senior investigating officer and
12 deputy?
13 A. Yes, sir.
14 Q. Who was going to be the senior investigating officer?
15 A. It would have been myself, sir.
16 Q. Who was going to be your deputy?
17 A. DCI Angie Scott, sir.
18 Q. Did you speak with her and make that agreement?
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 Q. Can I now move to a series of meetings to put things in
21 a context of time. We have heard about a meeting at
22 5.05 in the late afternoon of the 21st when four
23 explosives officers gave a detailed briefing about the
24 nature of the devices that had been found?
25 A. Yes, sir.
25
1 Q. Do you recall being present for that meeting?
2 A. Approximately 5 pm, sir, yes.
3 Q. We have also heard about a meeting at which
4 an operational overview was given, that meeting at 6.15.
5 A. I have no record of that in my statement, sir, I can
6 see.
7 Q. Well, perhaps we can have on the screen page 853 of the
8 exhibits. This that you will be seeing in a moment is
9 a page from a log kept by Mr Forteath, who was the staff
10 officer for Mr McDowall. Zero in on the 6.15 time:
11 "Full meeting and a conference call to
12 West Yorkshire."
13 Then record of various people making contributions
14 to the meeting. Just before halfway down the set of
15 bullet points:
16 "DCS Boutcher, SO11, TSU, SO19 briefed".
17 A. That's helpful, yes, sir, I was at that meeting.
18 Q. By that time, does that record you saying that those
19 three divisions had received some form of briefing about
20 what was needed of them?
21 A. I think some form of update as to what the situation was
22 at that time, sir, yes.
23 Q. Can we next have page 232 of the documents, please.
24 This is another page of the transcript of your tape
25 recording. Right at the top of the page, do you see
26
1 these paragraphs:
2 "Later on that evening I spoke to Andrew, explaining
3 the detail of what I was aware. I discussed the
4 firearms authority for which I was applying with him and
5 also with Detective Chief Superintendent Tim White, who
6 would be the authorising officer ..."
7 Then:
8 "At 11.50 pm on Thursday 21 July ... Mr White
9 authorised upon my application to him for the deployment
10 of SFO SO19 teams, with regards to the intention to
11 locate and identify the people who were responsible for
12 the attacks, as produced from the images of the CCTV
13 footage."
14 So does that record you discussing with both Andrew
15 and with Mr White the need for a contingent
16 authorisation for the use of firearms by CO19 officers?
17 A. Yes, sir, it does.
18 Q. Andrew, in the operational policy log -- I can show it
19 on screen if I need to -- puts a time of a discussion
20 with you at about 9.50 that evening. Is that something
21 you recall?
22 A. I spoke to Andrew through that period, sir. The timing
23 I am afraid now I probably can't help you with.
24 Q. Moving on to another meeting, 10.10 that evening, one we
25 have heard about many times, that was another meeting of
27
1 the command team. Do you recall being present at that
2 one?
3 A. Yes, sir, I do. Approximately 10 pm, I have.
4 Q. Was that a general review of the investigation?
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 Q. Was anything said at that meeting about the possibility
7 of a media appeal?
8 A. Yes, it was discussed, yes.
9 Q. At that stage, did that seem to be finding favour with
10 the command team?
11 A. Yes, sir, for the following morning, because of the
12 public safety responsibility we have.
13 Q. I am at paragraph 10 of your statement now. Was
14 an instruction given to
15 Detective Superintendent Macbrayne who was responsible,
16 I think, for forensics at that meeting?
17 A. It was, sir, yes.
18 Q. What was that instruction?
19 A. It was to establish the contents of the bags or of any
20 clothing discarded by the attackers as a priority and
21 that followed from our learning from 7 July when each of
22 the bombers had carried forms of identification.
23 Q. Just pursuing that point through, were you aware of any
24 difficulties or delays that occurred in examining the
25 rucksack from the Shepherd's Bush attack to which
28
1 Mr Osman was linked?
2 A. At that time, no, sir.
3 Q. Did you later become aware of such difficulties?
4 A. Recently, sir, yes.
5 Q. Can you say what they were or would you rather not?
6 A. It wouldn't be for me to say, I don't think, sir.
7 Q. I see. Now, at the time of the 10.10 meeting, is this
8 right, a CCTV trawl was underway; the MPS was fervently
9 looking through the CCTV footage in various places to
10 try to find good images of the suspects?
11 A. That's correct, sir.
12 Q. Is this right, at that time, at the time of that
13 meeting, there were two good images?
14 A. There were, sir, yes.
15 Q. From which sites were they?
16 A. They were from the Oval and from the bus attack, sir.
17 Q. So not Mr Osman, not Shepherd's Bush?
18 A. Not at that time, sir, no.
19 Q. Was anything decided at that meeting about firearms
20 authorisation?
21 A. It was shortly after that meeting, sir, that I certainly
22 approached Mr White and obtained the authority for the
23 firearms.
24 Q. We have heard that he gave oral authority just before
25 midnight?
29
1 A. Yes, sir, I believe it was 11.50.
2 Q. And that authority was later written up?
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. He has told us that the authority contains your
5 reasoning but signed off by him?
6 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
7 Q. I am at paragraph 11 of your statement now. Did you
8 give DCI Scott any instruction about arranging firearms
9 cover?
10 A. I asked DCI Scott to identify the Silver firearms
11 commanders for potential deployment for the morning,
12 sir.
13 Q. So for potential deployment because no specific address
14 or operation had been identified by this stage?
15 A. That's correct, sir.
16 Q. Perhaps the jury could look in tab 40 of the jury bundle
17 at page 31 of that. I don't know if the jury bundle can
18 be made available to the witness.
19 A. There is a jury bundle here, sir.
20 Q. Good. I don't know if it's been updated, if tab 40 has
21 the firearms authority in it.
22 A. Yes, sir, it's here.
23 Q. Good. Now, I am not asking for this to be put on screen
24 in case a redaction has not been made. Page 31 in the
25 bottom right-hand corner, please. I'll read out the
30
1 entry:
2 "DCI Scott tasked to identify and brief Silver
3 Commander for deployment with SFO standby team who will
4 remain at base awaiting intelligence developments."
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 Q. Now, you have said that the task for DCI Scott was to
7 identify Silver Commanders for possible deployment?
8 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
9 Q. The reference here is to "brief Silver Commander for
10 deployment with SFO standby team". Had a standby team
11 been identified by this stage?
12 A. This document, sir, if I put this in context, this is --
13 I wrote this document after the meeting with Mr White.
14 I think I went off shortly after 2.30 and this is the
15 document I was doing before I went off. That entry is
16 for DCI Scott, as I have already explained, to arrange
17 the Silver Commanders for the teams in the morning. By
18 brief, it's to make sure that -- and however she did it,
19 to make sure that they were aware that they were
20 a contingency for the morning teams, of which we had
21 two.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: This is in fact your document, is it?
23 A. I wrote this, yes, sir.
24 MR HOUGH: Mr White confirmed that Mr Boutcher --
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You are quite right, he did, yes.
31
1 MR HOUGH: I think in fact this page has been redacted, so
2 page 31 of the jury bundle can now be put on screen.
3 It's the middle part of the page, "DCI Scott tasked".
4 Then does it go on to say:
5 "Surveillance teams from SCD11 [which you have
6 spoken about] and SO12 also mustered as contingency and
7 teams allocated to day and night cover under the
8 direction of..."
9 Then an officer from SO12?
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 Q. So is that recording what had been done by the time you
12 left to set up the resources for deployment of, first of
13 all, firearms teams and secondly surveillance teams?
14 A. Yes, sir.
15 Q. Was the purpose of having a standby team and having
16 Silver Commanders briefed to allow for a specialist
17 firearms officers team to be sent at short notice?
18 A. This document, sir, as I say, was what I was doing
19 over -- well, until I left at 2.30. So this covers the,
20 if you like, arrangements I have made for the morning,
21 but I had put in place a contingency overnight with
22 surveillance and with the senior tactical adviser,
23 Andrew, in the operations room, and a single team
24 existed on standby in a Central London location, as
25 I understood it.
32
1 Q. I don't think we need to be mysterious about that,
2 because it's been discussed before; that was the base at
3 Leman Street; is that right?
4 A. My understanding was, sir, yes.
5 Q. I think that can be taken off screen for the moment.
6 I am now at paragraph 12 of your statement. Did you
7 discuss the firearms strategy with Mr McDowall?
8 A. Yes, sir.
9 Q. Did you also discuss it with Mr White?
10 A. Yes, sir, I did.
11 Q. What was the conclusion of those discussions?
12 A. In effect, if we identified that suspects were at
13 a given premises, inside a specific location, we would
14 be likely to adopt a negotiation, a containment and
15 negotiation strategy at that location.
16 Q. As opposed to?
17 A. As opposed to -- that would, if you like, that tries to
18 articulate where we finally identified where our bombers
19 are, and I can explain as the operation continued, we
20 did on occasion identify where our bombers were, as
21 opposed to watching, learning, listening to try to find
22 out where they had in fact gone after the events of the
23 21st, through surveillance and various other techniques
24 to try to locate them.
25 Q. Can we have page 205 on screen, please. This is a page
33
1 from your running log?
2 A. Yes, sir.
3 Q. It's about halfway down the page:
4 "DCS White authorised the firearms deployment."
5 We know, and then you are recording this:
6 "Should intelligence develop and suspects be located
7 and identified within premises, this would be
8 a containment and negotiation strategy. The tactical
9 option of a rapid entry is not likely under the
10 circumstances of this investigation. Upon being
11 identified and located, subjects shown in any CCTV
12 imagery will be arrested at the earliest and safest
13 opportunity. There will be no evidence-gathering
14 process. Public safety dictates the need to urgently
15 arrest these men."
16 A. Absolutely, yes, sir.
17 Q. Does that accurately record the tenor of your
18 discussions with Mr McDowall?
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 Q. That can be taken off screen now. In the course of this
21 evening, did Andrew make any recommendation to you about
22 the use of specific ammunition?
23 A. He did, sir, yes.
24 Q. Which ammunition was that?
25 A. That was a particular round of ammunition used by the
34
1 sky marshals that specifically has a far better stopping
2 capability and because of the energy in the round, it
3 tends to stop in what it hits, so it won't go through
4 a human being and then have an effect on a passing
5 person or somebody standing next to the person that's
6 shot with it.
7 Q. Did you mention this to Mr White when applying for the
8 firearms authorisation?
9 A. I did, sir, yes.
10 Q. We know that Andrew later wrote up the rationale for the
11 use of that ammunition?
12 A. Yes, I believe he did, yes, sir.
13 Q. Can I now move on to decisions taken after that
14 10 o'clock meeting. Did you have a discussion with
15 Mr McDowall and Mr White at any stage about the need for
16 a designated senior officer specific to this operation?
17 A. I did, sir, yes.
18 Q. Did that lead to a further meeting with commanders
19 Carter and Allison in a nearby hotel at about 1.15 on
20 the morning of the 22nd?
21 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
22 Q. Can we please have on screen page 232 of the documents.
23 Again this is part of your tape recording from a day or
24 so after the events?
25 A. Yes, sir.
35
1 Q. At the very bottom of the page, do we see this:
2 "In the early hours of the morning, approximately
3 1.15 am, Andrew, DCI Scott and myself went and spoke to
4 Commander Carter and Allison with regards to the rather
5 unique position of requiring a DSO in the pre-planned
6 operation we were preparing. The circumstances we
7 currently face are outside the conventional and well
8 rehearsed operations, generic operations Kratos and
9 Clydesdale, which deal with suicide attacks and
10 pre-planned public events, to address the threat of
11 a suicide attacker. The position of having four failed
12 suicide bombers in London, proactive investigation to
13 seek out these suicide bombers, could clearly lead to
14 a position of locating, controlling and attempting to
15 secure and arrest a suicide bomber. This clearly
16 required the contingency of a DSO within the operations
17 room to be conscious of the developing intelligence
18 should the scenario emerge and be able to step in and
19 take control should a DSO be required to make decisions
20 with regards to a critical shot. Then a decision was
21 taken that evening that a DSO would be appointed to the
22 ops room and Commander Cressida Dick was to attend New
23 Scotland Yard at 7 am."
24 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
25 Q. Perhaps that can be taken off screen again for the
36
1 moment. So were you on that evening thinking that this
2 was a scenario which didn't neatly fit into either
3 Operation Kratos, spontaneous events, or Operation
4 Clydesdale, pre-planned events?
5 A. Yeah, precisely, sir, yes.
6 Q. What did that lead you to conclude about the need for
7 a DSO?
8 A. As a contingency we might be confronted through the
9 operations room with a subject who was one of the failed
10 suicide bombers, and we may require the DSO capability
11 to manage the firearms option to address the threat of
12 a suicide bomber.
13 Q. Does that record accurately that Commander Dick was
14 warned immediately to attend New Scotland Yard at 7 am?
15 A. She was telephoned at the end of the meeting, sir, yes.
16 Q. I think just to fill in what you were doing after 10 pm,
17 just to show that you weren't sitting idle, you were
18 dealing with quite a number of matters after that time,
19 weren't you?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. Information, I think, was coming in from the various
22 scenes of the attempted attacks, and did you have to
23 deal with that information?
24 A. During that period, sir, I was making sure that we had
25 the relevant people in place; the ops room staff, the
37
1 ops room co-ordinator and deputy for the evening, that
2 they understood what Andrew's role was; the firearms
3 authority took some time to put together; and generally
4 just to make sure there was a clear understanding of
5 what was in place overnight; and the intelligence feeds
6 and in fact briefing and informing the thirst for
7 knowledge from partner agencies, intelligence agencies
8 were significant, so they understood exactly where we
9 were and the up-to-date position as far as the police
10 were concerned.
11 Q. Did you occupy an important position in relation to the
12 question of co-ordinating the Metropolitan Police with
13 other agencies?
14 A. Certainly with regards to the intelligence agencies and
15 what we knew and when we knew it, yes, sir.
16 Q. Did you also have a discussion with Andrew over this
17 period about the use of CO19 outside the area for which
18 the Metropolitan Police is responsible for policing?
19 A. I did, sir, yes.
20 Q. What was his advice about deploying CO19, his people,
21 outside the MPS area?
22 A. He was against that, sir. He thought that we needed to
23 keep what we had, firearms capability, within London.
24 Q. Did you make any plans for deployment of anybody outside
25 of London?
38
1 A. Because of, we didn't know the scale of this, we had had
2 the attacks on the 7th and the 21st, my assessment was
3 London was going through a unique period, and I was
4 trying to make contingency for further attacks
5 potentially elsewhere, so I did seek to make measures,
6 put measures in place for firearms capabilities outside
7 London including military assets, sir.
8 Q. When the jury is taken to various pages in your notes,
9 they may see the words "fly teams". Can you explain
10 what those were?
11 A. That was something that that evening we discussed
12 putting together effectively. We came to the conclusion
13 of two teams with specialisms within the team to be able
14 to go anywhere in the country to, if you like, start
15 a proper co-ordination facility if there was an attack
16 in Birmingham or Manchester, to assist local police
17 forces with regards to the learning we had had in
18 London. That would include intelligence functions,
19 command functions, the learning we had had from 7/7, so
20 that there was an ability to put people around the
21 country very quickly.
22 Q. Was that something else you were doing that evening
23 after the 10 pm meeting?
24 A. Yes, it was, sir.
25 Q. Could we next have page 206 of the documents on screen.
39
1 This is part of your log, again, and it's the top of the
2 page:
3 "Detective Superintendent Mick Taylor of SO13
4 intelligence head to ensure operations room and
5 Commander Carter ..."
6 He was the oncall DSO, we have heard?
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 Q. "... receive all intelligence available to service
9 Mr Carter's role. All intelligence relevant to the GT
10 DSO ..."
11 GT is the place he was, I think?
12 A. That's another location in Scotland Yard, sir, yes.
13 Q. "... known to the SO12 operations room will be passed
14 immediately."
15 A. And that, I think, sir, was from my recollection from
16 the meeting I had with Mr Carter at the hotel to make
17 sure there was also an intelligence flow to him.
18 Q. So as well as dealing with the appointment of
19 Commander Dick, were you also ensuring that intelligence
20 that you got on the 16th floor permeated down to him in
21 this other location?
22 A. Any relevant intelligence that there was a line of
23 communication to ensure that he got that, sir, yes.
24 Q. Did you also consult with Andrew to arrange for
25 explosives officers to attend at Leman Street where the
40
1 firearms officers were?
2 A. Yes, sir, Andrew had said to me he would want our
3 explosives officers to give some information and
4 awareness and expertise about the devices and I think
5 the effect of firearms on the devices, to properly
6 inform these firearms teams that morning at 7 o'clock.
7 Q. Sorry, perhaps we can have that document back on screen.
8 Is that recorded in the second paragraph of that page?
9 A. Yes, it is, sir.
10 Q. Then in the third paragraph:
11 "Commander McDowall as Gold Commander will liaise
12 with relevant DSO to ensure that fast-time intelligence
13 is being passed without delay and the command structure
14 remains fit for purpose."
15 Now, relevant DSO there, is that Mr Carter,
16 Commander Dick or somebody else?
17 A. I believe that from my recollection was actually
18 Commander Carter.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: He being the oncall DSO?
20 A. Yes, sir, in GT, yes.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: He wasn't specifically allocated to
22 this operation; he was there as the DSO to deal with any
23 problems that arose during the night?
24 A. Yes, sir. If I can expand, Operation Kratos, there was
25 a model in place where for spontaneous calls from
41
1 a member of the public or as a result of police officers
2 in uniform being called to something and having
3 concerns, there was a model in place, a structure, where
4 a DSO would be in a communications centre effectively to
5 manage that risk. That role was performed that day on
6 the 21st by Mr Carter, and I believe the next day as
7 well, sir.
8 MR HOUGH: Then just going down the page to finish the
9 entries here, you record that Andrew, the night team
10 tactical adviser, will record firearms options in a log,
11 and we have seen that log.
12 Then you write this:
13 "Chief Inspector Noel Baker, ops co-ordinator, night
14 duty, informed 0300..."
15 Is that the time or a place?
16 A. I think that's me, sir, because of doing the firearms
17 log, that must be the time I actually left approximately
18 having finished writing up the firearms authority.
19 Q. "... informed [at 3 o'clock] to contact me regarding any
20 developments and informed of RH hotel..."
21 That's a nearby hotel?
22 A. It is, sir, yeah.
23 Q. "... where I would be staying."
24 A. I put that, sir, because I had stayed there previously
25 because of the recent attacks and my role, and the
42
1 mobile phone signal was partial, so I was concerned, so
2 I wanted them to know what hotel I was in, and it went
3 on the board in the ops room as well, what hotel I was
4 staying in.
5 Q. Thank you very much. That document can be taken off
6 now.
7 Can we draw some threads together. At around 2.30,
8 3 o'clock, you were going off duty to snatch a very
9 short period of sleep?
10 A. I went home to get some clothes actually first, sir, and
11 then came back to the hotel and rested.
12 Q. By that stage you have a firearms team on standby at
13 Leman Street?
14 A. Yes, sir.
15 Q. That's the orange team, I think?
16 A. It was, sir, yes.
17 Q. DCI Scott, you have instructed to identify Silver
18 Commanders and give them an update?
19 A. To make sure they understand they are in place for the
20 morning, sir.
21 Q. Did you know, by the time that you left, who those
22 Silver Commanders were that she had identified?
23 A. I didn't, sir, no.
24 Q. Were you aware whether there was anybody on duty
25 overnight who would perform a Silver Commander role if
43
1 that was required, somebody was required to go out with
2 the firearms team while you were away?
3 A. If there would have been, and we had it subsequently in
4 the investigation, somebody phone up to say, one of the
5 bombers is at a given address and a relative or friend
6 or something of that nature or a source to the police,
7 if that had happened, there were people there who could
8 do that role. Particularly, and I had discussed it with
9 him briefly, DCI Mellody, who like myself is
10 an ex-Flying Squad officer, who has performed the role
11 of Silver quite a lot, and overnight, obviously this is
12 subsequent to the events, I know that Alan, who is the
13 deputy ops room co-ordinator, he was the Silver for the
14 surveillance team that went out during the evening.
15 Q. So if information had come in that a bomber was in
16 a specific place --
17 A. Yes, sir.
18 Q. -- and the desire had been to send out the orange team
19 while you were absent?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. First of all, who at New Scotland Yard would have made
22 the decision to send out that team?
23 A. Well, the ops co-ordinator is in charge of arranging and
24 facilitating the command and control of the ops room, so
25 he would be -- which is when Andrew was situated and
44
1 where the surveillance is managed and run from, they
2 report into that command room -- so the ops
3 co-ordinator, who is the DCI, Mr Baker, would have been
4 responsible for that.
5 Q. So if a 999 call had come in or some intelligence had
6 come in, that would have been routed to Mr Baker and he
7 would have made the decision to send out the orange
8 team?
9 A. Again, sir, what I would say overnight there, you had
10 Mr Macbrayne, who is a senior investigating officer,
11 superintendent; you have Mr Mellody, who is a senior
12 investigating officer; you have Mr Baker. I am sure
13 there would have been a collection of expertise and
14 views, but Mr Baker was in charge of actually managing
15 those specialisms that go out on the ground.
16 Q. He had, over that period of time, a number of people,
17 notably Mr Mellody, who could have gone out with the
18 team, had that been wanted?
19 A. Yeah, and indeed, sir, the deputy, and this is looking
20 at it now, the deputy ops room co-ordinator was in fact
21 the Silver Commander for the firearms teams, Alan
22 performed that role.
23 Q. I think you said he was Silver for the surveillance
24 teams?
25 A. Sorry, he was Silver for the surveillance, but he could
45
1 have performed the role of Silver. That's an example
2 of, he performed that role of Silver that night. And
3 what had been put in place, I don't know if it's been
4 fully explained, there was the SO13 sort of operational
5 room which co-ordinated a lot of the assets and the
6 staffing, and they were able to call people in, and
7 a lot of people were staying in local hotels in very,
8 very few minutes, 10, 15, 20 minutes people could have
9 been at Scotland Yard. And I think effectively that's
10 what happened with regards to some of the events in the
11 evening.
12 Q. The SO13 operational room you have just referred to, is
13 that different from the 16th floor?
14 A. Yes, it is, sir. It's on the 15th floor and it's more
15 knowing what officers have what particular skills
16 because you have to have certain training, specialisms
17 to perform certain roles, so they would be, if you like,
18 the co-ordination centre for those people being
19 allocated to certain requirements that I might have or
20 other colleagues.
21 Q. So you went off duty at sometime between 2.30 and
22 3 o'clock?
23 A. Yes, sir.
24 Q. Paragraphs 16 and 17 of your statement, did you receive
25 a call to your hotel while you were there?
46
1 A. I did, sir, yes.
2 Q. What time was that call?
3 A. I believe around about 6 am from recollection, sir.
4 Q. Who was that from?
5 A. I am trying to find it in my statement at the moment.
6 That was Mr Forteath, sir.
7 Q. Did you return to New Scotland Yard having received that
8 call?
9 A. I did, sir, yes.
10 Q. When did you arrive?
11 A. 7.10 in the morning, sir, I arrived on to the 15th
12 floor.
13 Q. By that time, I think a number of developments had
14 occurred?
15 A. Yes, sir.
16 Q. First of all, the gym card we know had been found, and
17 that that had communicated Osman's name, photograph and
18 the Scotia Road address?
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 Q. I think also the gym had been visited and a name and
21 photograph of Mr Omar had been identified?
22 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
23 Q. Had Osman's photograph been compared with CCTV footage
24 which had now been obtained of the Shepherd's Bush
25 attempted bomber?
47
1 A. Yes, sir, that's correct.
2 Q. What was the conclusion of that comparison?
3 A. That there was a likeness, sir.
4 Q. Was Omar's photo compared with any of the other
5 suspects?
6 A. Warren Street, sir, yes, attacker, and similarly there
7 was assessed to be a likeness.
8 Q. By this stage, you are back at 7.10, I think the
9 Portnall Road address had been identified from DSS
10 records as being linked to Omar?
11 A. Yes, sir.
12 Q. The Nissan Primera car, had that been identified also?
13 A. Yes, sir.
14 Q. How had that been identified?
15 A. My understanding from then establishing the facts is
16 that a surveillance team had done a trawl of the area
17 and had found the vehicle in close proximity to the
18 Scotia Road address.
19 Q. Before they had done the trawl, I think the car had been
20 found through some driving records as being linked to
21 Mr Omar?
22 A. It had been found through an intelligence database as
23 linked to Mr Omar, yes, sir.
24 Q. Now, can we now look at page 234 on screen? This is
25 another page from the transcript of your tape. You, in
48
1 the first two main paragraphs on the page, describe your
2 return to New Scotland Yard and then the third
3 paragraph, does that summarise the events that we have
4 just gone through which had happened overnight and which
5 you were informed of on your return?
6 A. Yes, sir, it does, yes.
7 Q. Then the next paragraph, do you note that the CCTV
8 footage trawl had identified images of all four
9 attackers by that stage?
10 A. It had, sir, yes.
11 Q. Again that can be taken off screen now. I'm at
12 paragraph 17 of your statement. In the last sentence of
13 that, you say that a CO19 team were at that stage to be
14 deployed to Scotia Road to provide an armed intervention
15 capability?
16 A. Both Scotia Road and Portnall Road actually, sir, yes.
17 Q. Had teams been allocated to each of those two addresses
18 by the time that you arrived?
19 A. They had, sir, and Silver Commanders appointed and
20 tactical firearms advisers appointed, sir.
21 Q. I think the black team, or a team primarily composed of
22 the black team, had been identified for the Scotia Road
23 address?
24 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
25 Q. And the orange team for the Portnall Road address?
49
1 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
2 Q. Who was to be the Silver for the Scotia Road address?
3 A. Scotia Road was Chief Inspector Purser, sir.
4 Q. And for Portnall Road?
5 A. Was Detective Inspector Merrick Rose, sir.
6 Q. When you arrived, did you attend a meeting?
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I think I have just had a question from
8 the jury, which I think has just this minute been
9 answered. Presumably those officers, Mr Purser and
10 Mr Rose, had been identified by Chief Inspector Scott?
11 A. I am not sure of the provenance of that, sir. When
12 I arrived in the meeting at 7.10, it was quite apparent
13 to me and I spoke to people immediately afterwards to
14 establish the position that Mr Purser had been allocated
15 to Scotia and Mr Rose to Portnall.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Whether that was Chief Inspector
17 Scott's doing or somebody else, you don't know?
18 A. Subsequently, I believe that Mr Rose was called out when
19 we had the one address, and I believe Mr Purser was
20 called in slightly earlier but he was one of the
21 officers, I think, to come in anyway at 7 am, but he
22 would have to account for that, sir.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well.
24 MR HOUGH: We heard yesterday about precisely when Mr Rose
25 was called in, and saw some documents about that.
50
1 You arrive at 7.10. Did you attend a meeting
2 involving Mr McDowall at that point?
3 A. I did, sir, yeah. I came into the meeting at 7.10 that
4 was concluding, really, I think.
5 Q. That was a meeting which I think had started at about
6 6.50 in the SO13 conference room?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. As a result of that meeting, did you give any
9 instruction to DCI Scott?
10 A. I can't find that bit in my statement, sir.
11 Q. Perhaps I can prompt you with a document, page 255,
12 please.
13 A. Thank you, sir.
14 Q. The last two sentences on that page, perhaps you can
15 interpret your hieroglyphics?
16 A. I don't think even I can do that, sir. I think it's
17 just to make sure that the intelligence that we had got
18 has -- that Silver Commanders are aware of the updated
19 position, and one of the things I certainly did after
20 the meeting, following on from my conversations with
21 Andrew the night before, was to ensure that the best
22 images that had been made available during the evening
23 were being issued to the firearms officers and, indeed,
24 those best images through the surveillance manager, who
25 I don't believe has a pseudonym, for the early turn?
51
1 May I say the name? An inspector.
2 Q. Let us leave it at that for the sake of caution.
3 A. I ensured that the early turn surveillance teams also
4 had been given the best photographs that were available
5 from the CCTV trawl.
6 Q. Yes. You can't say what the word to the left of -- is
7 there a word "Angie" there?
8 A. Yes, it does appear to be, sir.
9 Q. I am wondering whether that referred to an instruction
10 to DCI Scott?
11 A. That may look like "full research Andy, intelligence to
12 Silver", ie to make sure -- this was some three years
13 ago, sir, so forgive me -- that everything that we knew
14 at that time was collected together and that those
15 Silver Commanders who were going out were aware of the
16 information as it stood at that time.
17 Q. Can we have the previous page on screen, 254. These are
18 the entries in your red book when you come back, and we
19 see 22.7.05?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. Can you just read for us the first few sentences on that
22 page?
23 A. From the 22/7, sir?
24 Q. Yes.
25 A. "Any person out of the address is a challenge and" --
52
1 "... is a challenge and detain to Paddington.
2 Support team SO13 to bolt on..."
3 Which is to effectively be arrest teams is my
4 assessment of that, sir.
5 Q. Pausing there, did you do anything about arranging
6 a SO13 support team?
7 A. Again, I believe I asked, but it is a long time ago,
8 I believe I asked Angie Scott to arrange that, sir.
9 Q. She has given evidence that you asked her to arrange
10 that and she spoke to a DS Dingemans about arranging
11 that?
12 A. Right, sir.
13 Q. Then going on, the next line, please?
14 A. "Briefing document photos, SCD11 and SO19".
15 And these items are ticked.
16 Q. So that's a to do?
17 A. Yes, sir.
18 Q. Providing a briefing document and photographs to
19 surveillance and firearms teams?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. Then the next line, please?
22 A. "SO13 support teams to each address".
23 Which would refer to the entry or the remark you
24 made, sir, about Angie Scott and arranging Mr Dingemans
25 and a team also to support the address of Portnall Road,
53
1 of course.
2 Q. Then the next line, please?
3 A. "Expo [which is the explosives officers] to link with
4 SO19".
5 And that fits in with Andrew's request to have
6 explosives officers brief the firearms teams that he had
7 requested the evening before.
8 Q. I don't think we need the next line but what are the few
9 lines after that?
10 A. "Take subjects away from the address and establish
11 the" --
12 Q. Arrest situation?
13 A. "... the arrest situation regarding the premises and the
14 subjects".
15 Q. Perhaps we can take that off.
16 A. That may be "current situation", actually, sir, "the
17 current situation".
18 Q. I think it is, sorry. That was my incorrect prompt. So
19 just drawing that together, when you returned, and you
20 were in the meeting, was there any discussion in your
21 presence of the strategy?
22 A. Not in my presence, sir. What I established after the
23 meeting, sir, I certainly arrived as it was concluding,
24 was what the strategy was. Then I actually sought to
25 obtain from Mr Mellody, from recollection, who was in
54
1 charge of the intelligence effectively overnight, what
2 had occurred and he explained to me what had happened.
3 Then as you have explained, I was speaking to DCI Scott
4 to make sure that we had what we needed and also the
5 inspector in charge of the surveillance to reassure
6 myself that they had the appropriate photographs, the
7 most up-to-date ones, and if they were any emerging ones
8 that obviously something was in place for them to
9 receive those. And I would have been then appraised
10 also during that period and found out about the
11 strategy.
12 Q. Who told you about the strategy?
13 A. I don't specifically recall, sir, now. I think it was
14 Mr Mellody. It may even have been Mr McDowall.
15 Q. In that document we see a reference to dealing with
16 suspects and we also see a reference to the SO13 support
17 team as a bolt-on?
18 A. Yes, sir.
19 Q. As you understood it at the time, from what you were
20 told by whoever, what was the strategy for dealing with
21 suspects?
22 A. Suspects, there was no evidence-gathering process as we
23 had discussed the evening before, and any suspects would
24 be arrested, controlled by surveillance, until we were
25 able to get firearms officers to arrest them, the SFO
55
1 firearms officers, the specialist firearms officer
2 teams.
3 Q. By controlled by surveillance, do you just mean followed
4 and watched?
5 A. Yeah, and in all the operations I have conducted, the
6 surveillance team will secure surveillance control of
7 a subject, and then at an appropriate point when safe to
8 do so and it's managed locally on the ground in normal
9 circumstances, the subject is arrested.
10 Q. That's subjects. What was the role of the SO13 support
11 team to be?
12 A. They had something of a dual role, because they would
13 have been then the arrest officers to go forward. In
14 circumstances such as this the SO19 officers effectively
15 detain the subject. And then the SO13 officers would go
16 forward to take the responsibility for those subjects
17 and if you like, that prisoner handling process through
18 to the police station at Paddington.
19 Equally, they were responsible here as a contingency
20 for any intelligence gathering and potentially stopping
21 of other people that could have occurred, if any
22 opportunities presented themselves.
23 Q. Potentially stopping other people?
24 A. Yes, sir.
25 Q. What kind of people?
56
1 A. Well, if there was a decision taken that somebody wasn't
2 connected with or wasn't believed to be a suspect, and
3 as a contingency we thought there was an opportunity to
4 speak to people and we certainly didn't want to
5 compromise the operation and we didn't want to conduct
6 a firearms stop on the street on somebody, to have a
7 more discreet response, then they could perform that
8 role.
9 Q. At the time of that meeting, was there any discussion
10 about the nature of the premises at Portnall Road or
11 Scotia Road?
12 A. Not from my recollection, sir, no.
13 Q. Was there any discussion at that meeting, the tail end
14 of it there that you were there for or with the person
15 you spoke to about the strategy, about where
16 surveillance and firearms teams physically were?
17 A. At that stage, sir, I was quite aware that the Silver
18 firearms commanders were there. I came into the end of
19 that meeting and Mr Rose and Mr Purser were there, so
20 I was quite aware that the firearms teams would have
21 been at Scotland Yard, my assumption, or locally waiting
22 to be briefed by those Silver firearms officers.
23 Q. Because you don't send out an SFO team without its
24 Silver Commander?
25 A. Without that appropriate control vehicle with the Silver
57
1 Commander, yes, sir.
2 Q. And without the Silver Commander having briefed?
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. Did you know anything about the surveillance teams,
5 where they might be?
6 A. I became aware that the surveillance teams had been
7 deployed, sir, and were watching the addresses.
8 Q. The time that you were at the meeting, were you
9 surprised at all that there was a surveillance team,
10 certainly at Scotia Road, but no firearms team there?
11 A. Not when I arrived, sir, no. There is an inevitable
12 period in an initial deployment where the firearms team
13 will be slower in deploying than the surveillance team.
14 The surveillance team are put out there for the eyes,
15 the watching, learning, understanding of what's
16 happening at an address, and they can control people
17 from the address, and by control, forgive me, sir,
18 I mean surveill people.
19 Then the firearms team, especially when this is the
20 first morning, will be briefed. They have a tactical
21 briefing. They have a Silver Commander's briefing and
22 then they would deploy to an area that is secreted and
23 discreet away, so as not to compromise their existence
24 locally and join in any activity where anybody is
25 controlled from the address, surveilled from the address
58
1 and conduct an arrest.
2 Q. Was there any discussion at that meeting of when the
3 firearms team might get there or what might be done in
4 the meantime about stopping people coming out of the
5 premises?
6 A. No, sir, I came to the meeting at the end of the
7 meeting. It was literally concluding, so unfortunately
8 I can't give any information about that. What I was
9 then doing was trying to establish what the position
10 was, if you can appreciate, and subsequently I did go
11 into the ops room and we had a meeting in there.
12 Q. Now, you are in the -- attending the end of the meeting
13 at 7.10. What do you do over the next hour?
14 A. I have explained some of it, sir, to make sure the
15 photographs, and if you like, there was a bit of a list
16 from Andrew with regards to what he required for the
17 deployments to make sure that he was happy things were
18 in place, to make sure the surveillance manager was
19 happy and things had been done as he would wish.
20 Then from a -- from experience of operations, and
21 certainly recently, I was very focused on a particular
22 element of intelligence that has been exceedingly
23 fruitful, to make sure that we were exploiting those
24 opportunities and that they were in place, both within
25 my organisation and partner organisations, and then
59
1 having done those various things I went into the
2 operations room.
3 Q. During that period, were you also trying to ensure that
4 intelligence leads coming in from the various
5 investigations would get to the operations room?
6 A. Yeah. At the time there existed SO12, Special Branch,
7 and SO13, the Anti-Terrorist Branch, and you will see
8 references, and it can be quite confusing, to SCD, which
9 is the Serious Crime Directorate which is another part
10 of the Metropolitan Police that has its own
11 intelligence-gathering capability, to deal with,
12 I explained hopefully, organised crime. And all had
13 a part to play in this to provide some value to
14 identifying those responsible. But the important thing
15 is that they all channel that information into one
16 place, and that it's prioritised in the right way so
17 that the ops room receives it as quickly as possible.
18 So I was trying to make sure that all of that was
19 focused into the operations room and that that had been
20 put in place; and that, forgive me, sir, also we have
21 some other agencies we work with, to make sure that they
22 were fully briefed, understood what we were doing, where
23 we were going, they had been updated; and that they were
24 also, and that was one thing I did before I went into
25 the operations main room, they were tasked around adding
60
1 value to the investigation with regards to the
2 intelligence they can provide.
3 Q. After doing all those things following the meeting that
4 you joined at 7.10, what time did you arrive in the
5 operations room?
6 A. I did -- I would have swiped in. I did ask that the
7 swipe records were kept. I haven't got a recollection
8 but if the swipe records are available, we would be able
9 to see, sir, but I am imagining around about anywhere
10 between 7.30 and 8 o'clock. That's the best I could say
11 now, sir.
12 MR HOUGH: Sir, would that be a convenient moment for
13 a ten-minute break?
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You must be psychic. Ten minutes,
15 ladies and gentlemen.
16 (11.30 am)
17 (A short break)
18 (11.40 am)
19 (In the presence of the jury)
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, Mr Hough.
21 MR HOUGH: Mr Boutcher, so you are into the operations room
22 some time between 7.30 and 8 o'clock. Did a time come
23 when you attended a meeting in the forward intelligence
24 cell?
25 A. It did, sir, yes.
61
1 Q. What time was that?
2 A. I believe it was 8.15, sir.
3 Q. Can we have tab 20 of the jury bundle open and on
4 screen. This is a plan of the room which I think you
5 have probably seen before. Before we zoom in on
6 anything, the words "intelligence cell", that's the area
7 where the meeting is taking place?
8 A. Sorry, just orientating myself on this. Yes, sir,
9 sorry, yes.
10 Q. That's an overhead view. Looking in your statement, if
11 you need some assistance, who was present at that
12 meeting?
13 A. From my statement, I have Mr Connell,
14 Superintendent Connell; Superintendent Johnston, who was
15 the day shift ops room co-ordinator, who took the role
16 from Mr Baker; Detective Chief Inspector Mellody; DI
17 Southworth, who was a DI dealing with intelligence;
18 members of the forward intelligence cell themselves; the
19 staffing people present there; myself; Commander Dick;
20 and I am sure that Mr Esposito, the firearms day senior
21 tactical adviser was there.
22 Q. Did Commander Dick at that meeting explain anything
23 about how she proposed to implement Mr McDowall's
24 strategy?
25 A. She did. She explained that firstly that she was in
62
1 charge of the operations room, as the commander, to make
2 it very clear that she was taking the responsibility for
3 the room. Then she set out the Gold strategy of
4 Mr McDowall.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Could you explain this to me,
6 Mr Boutcher: Commander Dick now had made it plain that
7 she was in command of the operations room.
8 A. Yes, sir.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What was then going on was the
10 operation, as far as we are concerned, to contain and
11 control the possible presence of suicide bombers at
12 Scotia Road?
13 A. If I may, sir, you have Portnall Road and Scotia Road --
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I know, but I have left Portnall Road
15 because we are not particularly concerned with it.
16 Scotia Road.
17 A. Yes.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Go on.
19 A. As it was at that stage, there was a surveillance team
20 at Scotia Road.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's right.
22 A. And it would have been a case of identifying anybody
23 going from that address who was a possible suicide
24 bomber.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You appreciate we have all this in the
63
1 sense that we understand that. That was the operation
2 that was then going to be controlled from this control
3 room?
4 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What I want to be clear about is:
6 I know that you were the SIO for proactive
7 investigations.
8 A. Sir.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What, if anything, was your function in
10 relation to this specific operation?
11 A. Well, for instance, if I may, sir, I may have
12 established the fact through the enquiries that we
13 didn't need to be at this address, and I would have
14 instructed Commander Dick: I need the firearms
15 capability at that address now, at this address. The
16 information is emerging, it's developing, and through
17 a myriad of different sources, which is what I expected
18 to occur, we now need to move because we are tracking
19 the people responsible from the events on the 21st
20 through various means. So I had been responsible for
21 actually directing where people were going, and
22 Commander Dick was responsible for managing the arrest
23 and the nature of arrest of those individuals.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: If it was required.
25 A. If it was required, sir, yes.
64
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: So your position would be, if this is
2 the right way of expressing it, you were the liaison
3 between the operation that was going on for Scotia Road
4 and Portnall Road if you like, I will accept that.
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: And the intelligence that was coming in
7 as to whether or not either of those operations was
8 necessarily needing to be pursued?
9 A. Yeah, what I was doing, sir, was making sure that -- and
10 there is some innovative and imaginative ways that we
11 can do this -- that everything was being done to track
12 them and make some of the decisions as to where we
13 needed to focus.
14 So I might have taken the decision, because there
15 were some difficult decisions to take during this
16 period, that the priority needs to be actually somewhere
17 else, and we are simply going to move those assets away
18 to this address.
19 Then, as hopefully I have explained, Commander Dick
20 would, if we decided we were going to arrest people,
21 would be responsible for managing that, as we term it,
22 executive action, the arrest of those people on the
23 street, managing and being in control of the firearms
24 element and the surveillance element in effect.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you. That's what I wanted to
65
1 know.
2 MR HOUGH: A few questions arising out of those. First of
3 all, we need to be clear, I think, that this is not
4 an operation directed at just one address or even just
5 two addresses?
6 A. No, sir. I think there is a document that Mr McDowall
7 provided or Mr McDowall's staff officer provided that
8 had four addresses on it that morning, and there were
9 other addresses that I became aware of very quickly, and
10 was focusing upon with regards to where these
11 individuals were, and in effect who was supporting them,
12 who was going to provide them with clothing, travel
13 documents; was it going to be a case that they had
14 simply fled, or were they -- which was my main
15 concern -- reorganising somewhere to come back and
16 attack London, especially conscious of what we had
17 learned from 7 July, and that a bomb factory existed
18 there that had more than sufficient materials, component
19 parts and mixture to make additional devices.
20 So the focus was to find people as quickly as
21 possible.
22 Q. I will not take us back to Mr Forteath's log because we
23 have looked at it umpteen times, but by 8.15, four
24 addresses noted in that, Scotia Road, Portnall Road,
25 Blair House, Corfe House?
66
1 A. Yes, I believe that's correct, sir.
2 Q. You were responsible not just for co-ordinating the
3 operations against Scotia and Portnall, but as you have
4 said, also identifying if resources needed to be moved
5 from them to other addresses or new resources brought
6 onstream and sent to those addresses?
7 A. That's correct, yes, sir.
8 Q. Another area arising out of the learned Coroner's
9 questions, Commander Dick we know was appointed as DSO,
10 and we know that that's in textbook terms anyway, a role
11 which is required where a suspected suicide bomber is
12 confronted, actually confronted?
13 A. That's correct, sir.
14 Q. Were there any discussions between you and
15 Commander Dick when you arrived at the operations room
16 about the respective roles the two of you would play?
17 A. Yes, there was, sir. Obviously this was a new
18 challenge. The DSO function that existed for Kratos
19 People, Kratos Vehicle and Clydesdale, as I think you
20 mentioned, this situation sat outside of that. Those
21 were part of my thoughts and decision-making the evening
22 before to get contingency for a DSO, and Commander Dick
23 and I discussed and decided that she would manage the
24 operations room executive action, if I can term it that,
25 the arrest, because she was the senior officer and
67
1 because of the possibility that there may be
2 a requirement for that DSO element in the
3 decision-making process; but it was something that we
4 devised that morning because it was new to us. It
5 really was new to us.
6 Q. As far as you were concerned about how you would
7 interact, was she just going to stand back until there
8 was a confrontation with the suspected bomber or was she
9 going to play a more active part before that?
10 A. No, not at all, sir, forgive me, she would have played
11 and did play a very active part. I was there to liaise
12 with her, inform her, advise her as a Silver Commander,
13 and in effect had there not been the suicide element, if
14 this had been criminals that weren't considered
15 a suicide threat, that role would have been performed by
16 me, because this was something new that we had not faced
17 before.
18 So the evening before, before we had considered the
19 DSO element, I would in fact have performed that role,
20 and only potentially in as a school of thought, had we
21 had information to suggest there was definitely going to
22 be a suicide attack by that individual, would you
23 introduce the DSO element.
24 We made the decision, though, for ease and
25 simplicity of understanding that Commander Dick would
68
1 control the room as the senior officer and would manage
2 all of the arrest functions. What she would do is
3 enable the firearms Silver Commanders at the front end
4 to arrest people coming from the address if she saw it
5 as something they could manage, and she was happy with
6 that; if it was a potential suicide bomber that was
7 identified as a similarity to somebody the day before,
8 then she would manage that herself from the control
9 room. But she would make those decisions. She might
10 pass that responsibility to the Silver Commander for
11 those that weren't likely bombers but she would still
12 make that decision.
13 Q. The intention was that she would have on the scene both
14 the firearms team and the SO13 arrest team under
15 DS Dingemans?
16 A. They would be there ultimately, yeah, yes, absolutely,
17 sir.
18 Q. Dingemans says that he was instructed, I think, by
19 DCI Scott, to liaise with Mr Purser, the Silver
20 Commander --
21 A. Yes, sir.
22 Q. -- at the scene, and so he went from New Scotland Yard
23 to Nightingale Lane?
24 A. Okay, I don't know that, sir.
25 Q. Was that something you were controlling at the time or
69
1 was that something that simply followed from the
2 instructions you were giving to DCI Scott?
3 A. That would follow from the instructions, sir, that those
4 people, then, they have been given a specific role and
5 they would be expected to fulfil that and go and meet at
6 an agreed location.
7 Q. At around the time of the 8.15 meeting in the forward
8 intelligence cell, you and Commander Dick there, was it
9 realised at that time that the entrance to the
10 Scotia Road premises was communal for several flats?
11 A. I have to say my recollection, either shortly before
12 that meeting or immediately afterwards, and I don't know
13 which, I am afraid, sir, now, some time since, we became
14 aware it was a communal door.
15 Q. Were any decisions made by Commander Dick or yourself as
16 a result of that information coming in?
17 A. Well, again, if I can explain, people had been, in my
18 view rightly, allowed to leave the communal door.
19 I think the communal door services nine flats at that
20 location.
21 Q. That's correct.
22 A. On the basis that our information and our strategy was
23 to stop people coming from 21 Scotia Road, obviously to
24 arrest those who may have a likeliness to the bombers
25 from the day before, and to stop any other people away
70
1 from the address when safe to do so and to serve that as
2 an intelligence opportunity about what may be at that
3 address.
4 Because we have got the communal door, we took the
5 position that, if anybody came from that address who was
6 a likeness to one of the bombers, obviously and rightly
7 they would be surveilled by the surveillance team and
8 then arrested by the firearms team.
9 As the morning developed, my expectation and hope
10 was we would get control of the front door or the flat
11 at 21 Scotia Road, and by control, sir, I mean have
12 a clear understanding of when people left that flat
13 within that block.
14 Q. We don't need to go into quite how you would have done
15 that --
16 A. No, sir --
17 Q. -- but by technical means, I think.
18 A. -- but in effect that would have then allowed us to stop
19 other people going from that address. Coming from the
20 communal door, rightly, in my view, people weren't being
21 stopped. We became aware of that, and Commander Dick
22 agreed with the decision, we discussed it, and we
23 allowed that to continue.
24 Q. You were asked about this at the trial, the Health and
25 Safety trial last year, and it's page 163 for those
71
1 following, who have that transcript, of 3 October. You
2 said there:
3 "I had a conversation with Commander Dick either
4 shortly before or shortly after [that's the 8.10
5 meeting] and the decision was taken that we wouldn't
6 stop people coming from the communal door unless there
7 was a likeness or the surveillance team believed they
8 were the suspects from the imagery on the 21st."
9 A. Yes, sir.
10 Q. Now, the decision, you say, was taken "that we wouldn't
11 stop people coming from the communal door" either
12 shortly before or shortly after the meeting. Would you
13 accept that in fact people had come out and had not been
14 stopped before that decision was taken?
15 A. Absolutely, sir. What I think I became aware of, that
16 people were leaving the block and hadn't been stopped,
17 so I think that precipitated the question: why hadn't
18 they been stopped; and then there was the understanding
19 that because it was a communal door.
20 In effect then myself and Commander Dick had that
21 discussion and agreed that the best way to remain
22 covert, to find out enough about the address, just one
23 of the first addresses we had identified, was not to
24 stop people that may be from the other eight flats
25 coming from the address; and again, the learning we have
72
1 and subsequently in this investigation, key addresses
2 that we went to in blocks, and we may become aware of
3 Curtis House in this inquiry, there were two flats
4 within Curtis House, which is where the bomb factory was
5 for the attacks of 21 July in the one block.
6 So you have to be very cautious about who you stop.
7 You really do need to get a better understanding of what
8 linkages may be there. So the decision was taken by
9 Commander Dick then, rightly in my view, to enable
10 people to leave unless they were a likeness to the
11 suspect.
12 Q. Before that decision had been taken, it was happening on
13 the ground?
14 A. Yes, sir.
15 Q. Was that happening on the ground, ie people not being
16 stopped, because of a decision which had been made or
17 just because of a judgment call made by the surveillance
18 officers on the ground?
19 A. I don't know because I wasn't part of that process, sir.
20 My sense is it was probably a judgment call and rightly
21 so by the surveillance team.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I think we can work it out, because
23 this meeting in the forward cell was about 8.10, 8.15.
24 A. Yes, sir, 8.15, sir, I believe.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: My recollection is from what we heard
73
1 yesterday that some half dozen people left the house,
2 left the communal door, my recollection, between 6.30
3 and about 7.15.
4 MR HOUGH: I think it's -- no, I think that's wrong.
5 I think there were a number of people who left --
6 a couple of people I think left before 8.15 and then
7 four left between 8.15 and 9.34.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Sorry, I got my times wrong.
9 MR HOUGH: I am seeing nods. So only a couple before the
10 meeting, but I think four after the meeting.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The point is the same. Even if it was
12 only a couple, those first two presumably were allowed
13 to go as a result of a judgment call, as Mr Hough put
14 it, by the officers on the ground.
15 A. Yes, sir, I think so.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
17 MR HOUGH: Now, after that meeting, was anything done to
18 make everybody in the operations room aware of
19 Mr McDowall's strategy?
20 A. Yes, sir, there was -- what we did in the meeting was
21 make sure that everyone understood it who was there, and
22 then Commander Dick went to speak to the Silver
23 Commanders, who are the control element for what happens
24 out at each address, control vehicle, to speak to them
25 personally, and I believe it was Mr Johnston, who is the
74
1 ops co-ordinator, Superintendent Johnston, wrote on
2 the -- there is a number of white boards in the
3 operations room, wrote on one of the white boards the
4 details of the strategy.
5 Q. Can you remember what he wrote?
6 A. I did make a note of it, sir.
7 Q. It may be helped by page 236 in your tape transcript, if
8 that's put on screen. It's the second main paragraph:
9 "Following the meeting, Commander Dick provided the
10 aims and objectives to the operation. These aims and
11 objectives were recorded by Superintendent Johnston.
12 Those aims were in effect to ensure public safety, to
13 control the addresses, where possible taking people away
14 from the addresses and detaining them as an intelligence
15 capture and to arrest the suspects from the addresses
16 and secure and search any identified premises."
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. Breaking that down, "taking people away from the
19 addresses and detaining them as an intelligence
20 capture", is that using the SO13 arrest team?
21 A. That would be Commander Dick's decision, but
22 potentially, sir, yes, and I believe in the decision
23 log, it may be because of my recording in the decision
24 log I think might have come from the white board, there
25 might be a more accurate, almost word for word if my
75
1 recollection is correct, record of what was taken from
2 the white board.
3 Q. If we look, then, at page 208, please, on the page, if
4 that's a more accurate record, top of the page, on the
5 previous page it just says:
6 "The aims of the deployments are as given by Gold
7 Commander McDowall to control, challenge and arrest the
8 suspects as identified from the CCTV imagery. At the
9 addresses linked to the suspects, persons identified as
10 emerging from those venues but not the subjects were to
11 be controlled [so watched] going from the address. At
12 a safe distance those persons of interest will be
13 detained in order that an intelligence capture could
14 occur, regarding the occupiers of the addresses. This
15 process will serve to eliminate what may be historical
16 addresses and to establish the connectivity of the
17 suspects to these locations."
18 Then you write:
19 "At this time the priority was to ensure each
20 address was under proper control, establishing that each
21 front door is fully viewed to establish the movement of
22 and assist with the identification of occupiers."
23 Then you talk about other technical assets which
24 aren't of relevance to us.
25 A. Yes, sir, I do actually believe, and it's just my memory
76
1 now because of the time, that there was an entry that
2 numbered, in a numbered forum. Forgive me. (Pause)
3 I think it's at 1300, sir. That it's actually
4 written in the decision log. Mr Johnston may be able to
5 assist you, but I think that was what he wrote on the
6 board, exactly.
7 Q. 1300? Ah, I see, yes, page 13 of the log or page 240 in
8 the bottom right.
9 A. I may be confused by that, sir, but I have recollection
10 now that might have been what was on the board, but
11 Mr Johnston could assist you with that, I think.
12 Q. We will ask him. But we there see the numbered points:
13 "Ensure public safety, control addresses".
14 That's surveillance control?
15 A. Yes, sir.
16 Q. "Where possible take people away from addresses and
17 detain".
18 A. Yes, sir.
19 Q. So that's people other than the suspects?
20 A. Yes, sir, yes.
21 Q. "Arrest suspects".
22 Then three names, Nettle Tip which was Osman?
23 A. That's correct, sir.
24 Q. Regal Wave which was Omar?
25 A. Yes, sir.
77
1 Q. Then:
2 "5. Secure and search identified addresses".
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. Obviously when that became practicable?
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 Q. So something like that is written in --
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. -- the ops room by Mr Johnston. We can ask him about
9 that. A couple of other questions about the ops room:
10 how many people roughly were present in the ops room in
11 the period from 8 o'clock to 10 o'clock?
12 A. I would estimate around about a dozen, 15 -- a dozen,
13 15. Again swipe records may help with that. I don't
14 know if they have been captured.
15 Q. We have seen photographs of the operations room and
16 I don't ask them to be brought up yet. What was the
17 atmosphere in the room and what was the noise level?
18 A. The atmosphere was the first morning of the operation,
19 what happened the day before, it was very energetic,
20 very focused. Noise level as I would have expected;
21 people are talking, communicating, clarifying issues.
22 Noise level certainly wasn't quiet but it wasn't noisy,
23 or you know, too noisy that people couldn't understand
24 or couldn't carry out their functions; energetic,
25 I would say, sir.
78
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: How did it compare with the noise
2 levels generated in Operation CATTO, which would have
3 been a week earlier.
4 A. Sadly, sir, I wasn't -- because of what I was doing on
5 7/7 --
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You can't answer that question.
7 A. No. What might be helpful as a comparison is that
8 subsequently we have conducted some additional training,
9 and it's part of a surveillance training programme that
10 we have introduced for this sort of incident over
11 a three-day scenario, and the control room plays a main
12 function in that. Very similar levels of energy and
13 communication, I noticed, were replicated in the recent
14 training programmes where people really do need to
15 communicate very clearly what's happening in a fast time
16 environment. Certainly not quiet.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Certainly what?
18 A. Not quiet.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, I asked you. You couldn't answer
20 my question -- well, can you identify someone fairly
21 senior who was both present in Operation CATTO and was
22 present in the operations room during this period?
23 A. That would be Mr Connell, sir.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Mr Connell?
25 A. Yes, sir.
79
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: All right.
2 MR HOUGH: Now, can we have tab 20 of the jury bundle, the
3 plan back on screen, please.
4 Focus in, please, on the operations room. Now, just
5 to remind ourselves of how this room was laid out, you
6 have the straight desk of surveillance team monitors?
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 Q. Then a horseshoe-shaped configuration of desks behind
9 them?
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 Q. And some big screens in front of them?
12 A. That's correct, sir.
13 Q. So screens both immediately in front of each one and
14 larger screens above?
15 A. Yes, sir, terminals on the desk in effect, and there is
16 sort of TV screens above the front end, if you like, at
17 the top of the overhead.
18 Q. What was showing, if anything, on the higher and larger
19 screens?
20 A. There is an ability to show things like the surveillance
21 monitors log. I can't recall if that was being shown at
22 the time. You can actually put CCTV imagery and things
23 of that nature on there. News bulletins. I can't
24 actually recall at that time, I am afraid, sir.
25 Q. During the period from 8 o'clock to 10 o'clock were you
80
1 standing or sitting in any particular place or were you
2 moving around?
3 A. I was generally, where it actually is written
4 "operations room", sir, I was generally in that area
5 between the front and back rows of desks, the straight
6 row and the back row, and situated more towards, as you
7 look at the screen, the right-hand side where the words
8 "operations room" are written.
9 Q. We have heard that the surveillance monitor for
10 Scotia Road, who was called Pat, or has been given the
11 name Pat, was seated on the left of those straight desks
12 where we can see S1?
13 A. Yes, sir, that's correct.
14 Q. Does that accord with your recollection?
15 A. Yes, sir.
16 Q. Between 8.15 and 9.34, as we have heard, a number of
17 people, I think it's four people, came out of the
18 communal entrance of the block at Scotia Road?
19 A. Right, sir, yes.
20 Q. Were any decisions taken by Commander Dick about those
21 four people?
22 A. No, sir, as I say, the timing I am afraid I can't be
23 exact on, but people were allowed to leave the communal
24 door if they weren't known to come from 21 or not
25 a likeness of one of the suspects.
81
1 Q. Was that an as a result of a positive decision
2 Commander Dick was making or was it just being allowed
3 to happen without thought or consideration?
4 A. There had been the discussion around it, sir, which
5 I hope I have explained, so from that point forward, and
6 it was a decision that had already certainly been taken
7 because I became aware of people leaving the communal
8 door, rightly, by the surveillance team, and from that
9 point forward with Commander Dick's agreement, because
10 she could have changed that, people were rightly allowed
11 to leave.
12 Q. Who was forming an assessment of whether the information
13 from the surveillance monitors indicated that the people
14 were a good likeness to the suspects or not?
15 A. The surveillance monitors have got headphones on, to
16 understand your question, sir. They listen to the
17 surveillance channel and if anything of interest occurs
18 they would communicate that immediately to those in the
19 room, Commander Dick in this case is the most important
20 person, and myself, as to any -- anything that they want
21 us to be aware of, he, in this case, would speak to us
22 about.
23 Q. So Pat would swivel round and speak to one of you and
24 say: somebody has come out, they look like this.
25 A. Yes, and as the operation occurred, and we had many
82
1 surveillance teams out, each one would turn round and
2 say: this is now a significant development.
3 Q. During this period from the end of the meeting to when
4 Mr de Menezes comes out of Scotia Road, was there any
5 discussion of stopping bus routes in the area?
6 A. I don't personally recall that, sir, I am afraid, no.
7 Q. Another point, over this period, were you made aware of
8 any concerns or problems being identified by the
9 surveillance teams on the ground and passed to their
10 monitors?
11 A. Not at this time, sir. I mean, just if I can explain
12 the structure, the surveillance team would speak to the
13 monitors or in fact the gentleman I referred to earlier,
14 the surveillance inspector who was there, who I have
15 spoken to about making sure the images were there, I am
16 sure it was him, obviously it was a long time ago, he is
17 responsible with the monitor for making sure the
18 surveillance team's needs are met. They communicate
19 with them repeatedly, so anything would have been
20 brought to our attention that they couldn't deal with or
21 that was something they felt needed to go further up the
22 chain of command.
23 Q. Was anything brought to your attention in that way?
24 A. No, sir.
25 Q. 9.34, Mr de Menezes comes out of the communal door.
83
1 That's been fixed in time.
2 A. Yes, sir.
3 Q. Perhaps we can have the timeline at page 3 of tab 1 of
4 the jury bundle on screen, so that we can help ourselves
5 with the timings. This is agreed timings. Were you
6 notified by Pat when Mr de Menezes came out of the
7 communal entrance and was identified by Frank and the
8 other surveillance officers as being of a particular
9 description?
10 A. Pat told us when at 9.34 somebody came out of the
11 address who was a possible, I think, at that stage.
12 Yes, sir.
13 Q. I think over the next five or six minutes, while he
14 walked to the bus stop, he was observed by various
15 surveillance officers?
16 A. That's from the timeline, that's correct, sir, yes.
17 Q. Their entries were going into the log and I am not going
18 to take you to those entries, because we can deal with
19 those with the officers, but we know that at 9.39 he
20 boards the bus on Tulse Hill. 9.47, he gets off the bus
21 at Brixton and then a couple of minutes later he
22 reboards at Brixton. So that's the timeframe.
23 A. Yes, sir.
24 Q. Before I ask you a couple of questions.
25 A. Yes, sir.
84
1 Q. Did a time come when you gave an order in relation to
2 this man? I am at paragraph 28 of your statement, if
3 that helps.
4 A. Thank you, sir. Yeah, what occurred was that at first
5 there was at some level, and subsequently I have heard
6 additional information, at some level, a belief that
7 this gentleman was worth a second look or it could be
8 the suspect. Then it became apparent that he wasn't,
9 was not believed to be the suspect, and the surveillance
10 team had followed him on to a bus, as I understood it.
11 So there was, if you like, an opportunity that
12 somebody who had come from that address and had got on
13 to a bus, now not believed to be the suspect, was
14 travelling well away from the address. So I asked Chief
15 Inspector Scott to arrange for DS Dingemans, who was the
16 SO13 detective sergeant, if you like, the bolt-on phrase
17 that I used to support the firearms element, to be
18 tasked to stop that individual, using relevant theatre
19 and disguise not to reveal the police operation, of
20 course, to see if we could find out a little bit about
21 the address but in a discreet way, not to show out that
22 we were looking at the address in any way, shape or
23 form.
24 Q. So by the time that you gave that order, the feeling in
25 the control room was that from the information you were
85
1 receiving, this was not one of your suspects?
2 A. Yes, sir.
3 Q. With what degree of certainty did you and others in the
4 control room hold that belief?
5 A. That it wasn't the suspect, sir?
6 Q. Yes.
7 A. Absolutely that it wasn't, and that's indicative of the
8 fact that Dingemans was asked to go to stop him.
9 Q. Now, Dingemans himself says, certainly in a statement,
10 and we will hear from him in due course, that the order
11 actually came through the Silver Commander, Mr Purser?
12 A. Right, sir.
13 Q. Is that something you know anything about?
14 A. What I am aware of is that Commander Dick is in the room
15 and she is speaking to Mr Purser, so as the decision is
16 being made and myself and Commander Dick were talking,
17 completely joined up during this process and agreeing
18 these decisions, she would have been speaking to
19 Mr Purser who would have obviously had, as he is the
20 Silver Commander, communication with the different
21 groups on the ground.
22 Q. Just to pinpoint the timing, we know that Mr Purser
23 called Mr Dingemans at just before 9.49?
24 A. Right, sir.
25 Q. So that, at about the time that Mr de Menezes is going
86
1 up to reboard the bus in Brixton?
2 A. Right, sir.
3 Q. If that was the time of the order, and if your order was
4 given maybe a minute or two before that --
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 Q. -- then the order would have been given around the time
7 that the bus was coming towards Brixton?
8 A. I see that, sir, yes.
9 Q. Okay. Did a time later come when you countermanded the
10 order to Mr Dingemans?
11 A. Yes, it did, sir.
12 Q. Roughly how long after the first order was the new order
13 given?
14 A. It's very difficult now to say, sir. The surveillance
15 log may assist, but what happened was Pat, the monitor,
16 informed me or informed the room in effect, that they
17 did now believe the subject to be Hussain Osman.
18 Q. With what degree of certainty or confidence did he say
19 that?
20 A. Well, I tried to establish something that we have used
21 previously in another surveillance environment I have
22 been in on a scale of 1 to 10 of what that likeness was,
23 just to see how strong the likeness was viewed to be,
24 which Pat did very much try to establish, but was unable
25 to do so. And it's very difficult when you are doing
87
1 surveillance to be able to communicate sometimes. If
2 I can explain, the person with sight of the suspect may
3 not be able to talk, so we weren't able to establish by
4 that means.
5 But Pat was saying then that it was believed to be
6 him, it was him.
7 Q. Did you ask this question about the 1 to 10 scale of
8 identification, did you ask that before or after you
9 gave the new order to Mr Dingemans?
10 A. I actually think I was focused on asking that question
11 to establish the likeness, and then I cancelled
12 Dingemans, from my recollection, sir.
13 Q. Certainly the surveillance officers at the scene are
14 likely to say that when they got that question, they
15 said it's an impossible question to answer. Is that
16 a sentiment that got through to you?
17 A. Not at the time, sir, I have heard it subsequently, but
18 having run -- and I have no criticism of the
19 surveillance whatsoever, they have a very challenging
20 job, and there are slight variances on how different
21 surveillance units work, but on the National Crime Squad
22 and certainly when we were working on the Flying Squad,
23 it was that type of -- to give people a bit of clarity
24 about certainly in an early stage of an operation when
25 the subject has not been seen before, the likeness on
88
1 a scale is something that we have used elsewhere.
2 Q. Now, you have said you have made an order to --
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Sorry, could you just pause there one
4 minute. Your recollection is that Pat, on this occasion
5 was saying, the words you used, "it was believed to be
6 him, it was him".
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What did you take that to mean, so far
9 as the level of identification was concerned?
10 A. In my experience, sir, although Pat was saying that, the
11 first morning of an operation, the subject has not been
12 seen before, and I know the enormous challenges there
13 are in identification, I took that to be a good likeness
14 because it's really difficult to absolutely identify
15 somebody from a lot of experience of making mistakes
16 through surveillance teams and that being positive,
17 positive, sir.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Do I understand you correctly to say
19 that you would not have regarded that phraseology as
20 a positive identification?
21 A. A strong likeness, sir, on the first morning of
22 an operation, absolutely correct, sir.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Not a positive identification.
24 A. Not positive.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
89
1 MR HOUGH: So we have heard that you gave an order to
2 countermand Mr Dingemans; was that order given with
3 the intention of then giving another order to somebody
4 else.
5 A. Yes, that was to cancel Dingemans and then I said that
6 the SO19 team, the firearms team should now be moved up
7 to support the surveillance in anticipation of
8 an arrest.
9 Q. Can I just show you two pages of the surveillance
10 running log, the one you have been talking about, on the
11 screen. It's page 447 of the documents, please. This,
12 as you see, is the surveillance running log,
13 a print-out. Just for everybody's benefit, I think that
14 the times here are the time that the entry is made?
15 A. Right, sir.
16 Q. That may be a minute or two after the thing happens and
17 the information comes in.
18 A. Yes, sir.
19 Q. 9.34, unidentified IC6 or IC2, are they ethnic
20 descriptives?
21 A. They are, sir, yes.
22 Q. What are they, just for everybody's benefit?
23 A. A few years ago, I would have been able to tell you,
24 sir; now my memory fades from my surveillance.
25 Q. We may hear that from others. "Male, fattish face,
90
1 stubbled, 5-foot 10". "PIW"?
2 A. My interpretation of that, but the person who wrote this
3 needs to give that interpretation as to what they meant,
4 but would be "person ident with". Or "possible ident
5 with", actually, it could be.
6 Q. I think the explanation which may be given is "possible
7 ident with". "NT", is that Nettle Tip?
8 A. Yes, sir, I believe so.
9 Q. "... in jeans out of communal door". Then 9.39,
10 "Unidentified male on to bus".
11 A. Yes, sir.
12 Q. Then further information about the bus. 9.48,
13 "Unidentified male of bus". That probably means "out of
14 bus"?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. "And on foot towards further bus stop"?
17 A. Yes, sir.
18 Q. Over the page, please:
19 "Unidentified male waiting at bus stop".
20 That's him in Brixton?
21 A. Yes, sir.
22 Q. 9.52, "Unidentified male back on to same bus". 9.54,
23 "Believed unidentified male using mobile phone, possibly
24 texting, on the bus". Yes?
25 A. Yes, sir.
91
1 Q. Then 9.56 and 57, some further entries about the route
2 of the bus. Then 10 o'clock:
3 "Unidentified male on top deck but appears heading
4 down".
5 10.03, "Unidentified male off the bus".
6 10.05, "Unidentified male running on to escalators".
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 Q. It's an obvious point so it's one that I will put to
9 you. The running log coming up on the screen in front
10 of you, always referred to the subject of the
11 surveillance, Mr de Menezes, as "unidentified male"?
12 A. Can I go back to the last page, please, sir, if I may.
13 Yes, I agree with that. It's -- I notice it's the reds,
14 and then the grey seem to take the commentary, if you
15 like, in the log from 9.39. PIW is the key, and it has
16 to be the loggist and the person who made that remark
17 who will have to give the evidence about that, sir.
18 Q. That was at a very early stage when he was just out of
19 the door. We know that after that, the information that
20 you certainly say you received was that he was regarded
21 as not the suspect?
22 A. Yes, sir.
23 Q. Then later, the additional information comes through
24 that you have described that caused you to call off
25 Mr Dingemans?
92
1 A. Yes, sir.
2 Q. But throughout, even in that later stage, he is referred
3 to as "unidentified male"?
4 A. I haven't seen that log before, sir, but that doesn't
5 correlate with what we were told in the ops room.
6 Q. Were you looking at what was coming up on screen while
7 you were giving the orders in the ops room?
8 A. No, sir, I was talking directly to Pat, directly to Pat.
9 Q. Thank you very much, I think that can come off screen.
10 Now --
11 A. Sorry, sir, forgive me. That was the running log from
12 the ops room, not the surveillance log obviously.
13 Q. Not the log kept by the teams?
14 A. Right, okay.
15 Q. Yes. That's from the ops room. Each of the
16 surveillance teams, grey and red, had a handwritten log
17 which was separate from that?
18 A. They should do, yes, sir.
19 Q. Again, we will deal with all those in due course but
20 I will not swamp you with documents at this stage, just
21 because that's something that's coming into your room,
22 that's why I am taking you to it and giving you the
23 opportunity to comment on it.
24 Can I move on to the time after Mr Dingemans has
25 been cancelled. Over this time, is this right,
93
1 Commander Dick had an open telephone line to Silver?
2 A. Yes, sir.
3 Q. And that's Mr Purser?
4 A. It is, sir, yes.
5 Q. With the firearms teams?
6 A. Yes, sir.
7 Q. Mr Esposito, her tactical adviser, had an open telephone
8 line to Trojan 84?
9 A. He was in direct contact with, yes, the tactical leader
10 in the vehicle, sir, yes.
11 Q. So tactical adviser with Silver?
12 A. Yes, sir.
13 Q. So two lines of communication direct by phone?
14 A. That was my understanding, sir.
15 Q. At this point, so from 9.55 to the time of the shooting,
16 where were you and Commander Dick standing in the
17 operations room?
18 A. May I show you on the screen, sir?
19 Q. Of course, tab 20, please. (Pause)
20 A. Thank you. Commander Dick, as you look at the
21 right-hand side of the plan, I think it's shown as
22 Charlie 2, Charlie 1 and Charlie 3. Charlie 3 is where
23 the sort of surveillance managers are, surveillance
24 co-ordinators both for the Special Branch element and
25 the Serious Crime Directorate element. And
94
1 Commander Dick was standing, I would say, on the side
2 between those row of desks opposite C2 and towards S4
3 with the phone on that sort of desk in that area.
4 Q. So just behind the words we can see "Aquarius PC"?
5 A. More towards the right. The phone she was using was on
6 the desks that you see that serviced chairs C1 and C2.
7 It was one of the phones sort of in that area.
8 Q. Can a cursor be put on the screen, please?
9 A. Thank you.
10 Q. Can you just direct the operator.
11 A. If the cursor moves sort of basically to the right and
12 slightly down now, yeah, around about there, standing
13 with a phone on that desk.
14 Q. Can a mark be put there?
15 A. In that area, certainly. All the time it was ago. But
16 certainly around that area.
17 Q. Where were you at this time?
18 A. I was standing again between Pat, I was more over
19 towards the S1 chair, if you like, and turning round and
20 speaking to both Commander Dick and certainly where the
21 marker is there, perhaps a little bit to the right of
22 there I was, maybe a little bit further. About there,
23 I would suggest. And Mr Esposito --
24 Q. Can we just put a mark there? Thank you very much.
25 A. And Mr Esposito was seated at one of the, either at A3
95
1 or is that A6, chairs, they are the sort of areas that
2 the firearms --
3 Q. I think it's A4.
4 A. Is it? Forgive me.
5 Q. Immediately below the words "operations room"?
6 A. Yes, sir, that sort of area was where the firearms
7 managers were.
8 Q. We know that Mr de Menezes gets off --
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Do you want that marked?
10 MR HOUGH: It would be as well, yes.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You think he was sitting there, do you?
12 A. Mr Esposito was sitting down, he may have stood up from
13 time to time, but he is on the seat side of those desks
14 and he has a seat. Commander Dick was standing on the
15 phone, as you can see there is no chairs there, sir, and
16 I was standing moving between --
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I have got that. We have marked that.
18 It's only where Mr Esposito was.
19 A. He was sitting down.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: In A4?
21 A. Either A4 or A3, I think A4. But at times he would
22 stand, sir, as well, I have to say.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
24 MR HOUGH: We know that Mr de Menezes gets off the bus at
25 10 am. Was that relayed to the control room through the
96
1 surveillance monitor?
2 A. Yes, sir, I think there was an indication that he was
3 standing up, so that, if you like, signalled the fact he
4 was about to get off the bus.
5 Q. Was it known in the control room at that time whether he
6 was carrying anything?
7 A. I have to refer to my notes, sir. I don't believe so at
8 that stage, no.
9 Q. Could we have page 237 on screen, please.
10 A. I found a note in my statement, actually, sir.
11 Q. I see. I don't think we need the document on screen,
12 then.
13 A. I have the note that:
14 "The subject remained on the London Transport bus
15 travelling towards Stockwell tube station. Pat
16 indicated that the subject was apparently texting, using
17 his mobile phone, and was described as being nervous,
18 but he was not in possession of a bag."
19 Q. Thank you. He is getting up to get off the bus?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. That information comes through. Was any order given in
22 reaction to that?
23 A. I think I have explained that I turned to instruct the
24 SO19, Mr Esposito, to get the SO19 officers to move
25 forward for an arrest when safe to do so. But I heard
97
1 Commander Dick instructing the SO19 officers to move
2 forward literally at the same time. And she was, as
3 I have explained, on a telephone speaking directly to
4 Detective Chief Inspector Purser, who is the Silver
5 Commander in the control vehicle at that location for
6 the Scotia Road address.
7 Q. What response was given to those orders coming through?
8 A. I can't say what was said to Commander Dick because she
9 is on the telephone speaking directly to the --
10 Q. What does Mr Esposito say to you?
11 A. Mr Esposito said that they weren't in a position at that
12 stage to take control of the subject.
13 Q. Does Commander Dick take any action in response to
14 whatever information she is getting?
15 A. Well, the subject left the bus, sir, and started to walk
16 towards the Underground station. I informed
17 Commander Dick that she could instruct the Special
18 Branch surveillance team, the SO12 team as it's referred
19 to, to detain the subject, mindful of SO12 officers are
20 not trained in armed intervention, so it's not a tactic
21 they are trained to do, arrest someone at gunpoint.
22 They carry weapons for their self-protection. But in my
23 judgment, it was the right thing to do, it was
24 proportionate and a reasonable option, balanced against
25 the subject getting into the Underground network, if
98
1 indeed he was going to go into the Underground station,
2 because he is walking towards it, he could obviously
3 have walked past it, and potentially being lost to us
4 from surveillance because of the challenges of following
5 someone on the Underground system.
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: We have been told that another reason
7 why SO12 officers, Special Branch officers, would not be
8 asked to carry out arrests is because it might
9 compromise their covert status. I don't know how
10 important that would have been in this situation.
11 A. In this case, sir, it's an option of last resort for me,
12 because indeed, and we have to be conscious of
13 legislation and our responsibilities, we should use the
14 officers who are trained to conduct tactics such as
15 these to do them.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I understand that was a major
17 consideration. What I wanted to know was whether the
18 loss of covert status was also important.
19 A. In this case, proportionately, sir, not at all. That
20 would have been something that I would have seen as
21 a very small issue.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
23 MR HOUGH: The jury may hear that certain officers on the
24 surveillance teams will say that they communicated and
25 actually positively suggested that they might take some
99
1 action. Is that something that got through to you at
2 that time?
3 A. No, sir, but it's quite possible that they were saying
4 that to the surveillance monitor because as I have
5 explained, he's got the headphones on and the
6 surveillance channel isn't being broadcast in the ops
7 room, but that's quite feasible.
8 Q. So that's the decision that's been taken about SO12
9 officers. What comes through next to the control room?
10 A. Commander Dick does actually instruct the SO12 officers
11 to stop the subject, and Pat did, the monitor did relay
12 that. I heard him relay that to them. I have to say
13 Commander Dick was completely clear and calm in the
14 decision-making and the instructions she gave.
15 It was very clear, it was to conduct using SO12
16 an armed intervention and arrest. But almost
17 immediately, and it was literally immediately, sir,
18 I recall this well, we were then told that the SO19 team
19 were now in a position to arrest the subject. So if
20 I can explain, they are clearly making ground in their
21 vehicles to catch up with the surveillance and the
22 surveillance control of the individual who's now stepped
23 off the bus and is walking towards the Underground
24 station, so they are making that progress, and then we
25 got the information that they were in a position to do
100
1 it.
2 Q. May I pause you there. You said almost immediately, and
3 I know this may be an impossible question, like the 1 to
4 10 scale or things like that. Can you say roughly, 10
5 seconds, 20 seconds, a minute?
6 A. It certainly wasn't a minute, sir, I think it was
7 a matter of seconds, I would have said a matter of
8 seconds but it's very difficult to say exactly.
9 Q. So going back to that, you said that at this point the
10 information came through that CO19 are now in a position
11 to make an intervention; what order was given in
12 response to that information coming through?
13 A. Well, again rightly, because the team that are trained
14 to conduct that activity are there, Commander Dick
15 instructed DCI Purser on the telephone that SO19
16 officers would now conduct that arrest.
17 Q. Just pausing there, we have asked this of your deputy,
18 DCI Scott, as well: can you remember the precise words
19 she used in giving her order to CO19?
20 A. I don't know if, sir, in the other logs that you have of
21 mine whether I have recorded that, but I do recall she
22 said to stop the subject before he got on to the
23 Underground system, but I don't know if I have made
24 a note of -- and I very rarely make notes of exact
25 speech, relying on recording devices rather than memory.
101
1 Q. I'll come to that note in just a second. I will deal
2 with a couple of other questions first. That order, was
3 that given before or after it was known that
4 Mr de Menezes had passed the barriers and was going down
5 the escalator?
6 A. It's very difficult in the operations room, sir. You
7 have no visual understanding of where the subjects are.
8 My belief, my expectation was that the subject was
9 walking towards the Underground station and as the
10 events emerged and the information was given that SO19
11 were in a position -- and I know Stockwell, sir, I used
12 to work at Brixton, I know the Underground station very
13 well -- that he would be arrested literally immediately
14 outside or in the hallway area, it was quite a wide open
15 expanse area, of the Underground station.
16 Q. Did the information in fact later come through that he's
17 got through the barriers before CO19 have arrived?
18 A. There is the delay waiting which normally happens when
19 you instruct for an arrest to occur, there is normally
20 a delay while that takes place, is communicated and the
21 officers on the ground perform that tasking. The next
22 thing we are aware of, and we are told by Pat, is that
23 the subject was descending the escalator, still under
24 the control of the surveillance officers.
25 Q. At that stage, I think you lose radio and telephone
102
1 communication?
2 A. Yeah. Unfortunately because of the Underground station,
3 at the time our radios weren't -- didn't enable us to
4 listen to what happened when they went into the
5 Underground station.
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Does it follow from that that as Pat
7 was saying that he was still under the control of the
8 surveillance officers, that means that however far
9 behind they were, SO19 hadn't yet got to him, as it
10 were?
11 A. My expectation, sir, was that he was going to be
12 arrested in the entrance to the Underground station.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Upstairs.
14 A. Absolutely, sir, upstairs, ground level, as you walk in,
15 it's quite a wide open area as you enter.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: From what you were told just then, by
17 this time he was going down the escalators, still under
18 the control of the surveillance officers.
19 A. Clearly, sir, yes.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The inference from that would be that
21 CO19 hadn't yet got to him.
22 A. They hadn't yet -- that catching-up process, yes, sir.
23 MR HOUGH: Can we have page 211 on screen. This is part of
24 your operational log.
25 I am going to read a section and then ask a couple
103
1 of questions about it:
2 "Commander Cressida Dick instructed DCI Purser that
3 the subject should be detained before entering the tube
4 system. No communications were then heard due to the
5 effects of officers being underground. 10.15 hours,
6 I was informed that the subject had been shot by SO19."
7 Pausing there, these two paragraphs, can you recall
8 when you entered these into your log?
9 A. I can't, sir. What I did ask again to be done, and
10 I don't know if it has been achieved, the log obviously,
11 it's an electronic log, can be captured, because it's
12 a living document as you enter on to it, and I asked
13 that that be done after the event. The log was
14 finalised by me at the end of the operation. This was
15 begun that day. When exactly I made that entry
16 hopefully can be verified electronically but certainly
17 very quickly, you know, shortly afterwards.
18 Q. You asked about a record you made about the words of
19 Commander Dick or at least the summary of what she said,
20 and do we see there the record --
21 A. Yes, sir.
22 Q. -- made at some point of those words?
23 A. Yeah.
24 Q. Going on:
25 "GT [that's the other room in New Scotland Yard]
104
1 were informed, ambulance called, and DCI Purser to
2 attend scene."
3 Then this:
4 "I spoke to Chief Inspector Esposito, SO19 tactical
5 adviser, to clarify the position regarding the
6 intervention of the subject. Chief Inspector Esposito
7 stated that the SO19 officers were conducting
8 an orthodox armed intervention and the officers'
9 instructions were clear. The officers will have
10 challenged the subject and his responses will have
11 resulted in the officers' actions. This was not
12 a Kratos incident."
13 A. Yes, sir.
14 Q. Those words of Chief Inspector Esposito that are
15 recorded there, were they spoken before or after he had
16 heard from anybody at the scene?
17 A. Literally immediately that I had been informed that the
18 subject had been shot, sir, I said to Mr Esposito for
19 clarification because it was -- the events as I have
20 described them are how they occurred; that clearly this
21 was not a Kratos; this was an instruction to detain,
22 arrest somebody. And then whatever event occurred on
23 the Underground I cannot obviously give testimony for,
24 but the instructions to the officers were clearly to
25 detain that subject, not a Kratos, and because of the
105
1 unique circumstances of what we were facing and the role
2 of the DSO, I sought clarification of that with
3 Mr Esposito and he agreed.
4 Q. So you are recording there, is this right, that no order
5 was given from the control room for a critical shot to
6 be taken?
7 A. That's correct, sir.
8 Q. From the orders you heard, could any of those have been
9 misinterpreted by those on the ground as requiring
10 a critical shot?
11 A. No, sir, absolutely not. Commander Dick was very clear,
12 and it was to detain the subject.
13 Q. We have heard about you then being informed. We have
14 seen in the log you were then informed of the -- of what
15 had happened.
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. I think you then stayed on in the operations room to
18 manage and continue the investigation?
19 A. I remained running the operations room then until it
20 ceased to operate when we had arrested the relevant
21 people involved, I think around 1 or 2 August, sir. It
22 remained open 24 hours until the end of -- the
23 resolution of arresting those responsible for 21/7.
24 Q. Without going through all the different addresses you
25 had to deal with and all the different actions you had
106
1 to take, can you tell the jury briefly what the results
2 of the investigation were?
3 A. We conducted numerous armed arrests and armed call-outs
4 and entries to addresses. Records will reflect them.
5 Certainly considerable numbers. We arrested some 30
6 people, 16 of which, from the arrests from the control
7 room, were convicted for their responsibility either in
8 conducting the attacks 21/7 or aiding and abetting those
9 who conducted the attacks on 21/7, and that came through
10 the operations room.
11 Q. Did you ultimately arrest all those who were seen on the
12 CCTV as the suspects?
13 A. We did, sir, yes.
14 Q. Were any lives, either officers or theirs or third
15 parties, lost in the operation other than that of
16 Mr de Menezes?
17 A. Other than the tragic death of Mr de Menezes, no, sir.
18 MR HOUGH: Thank you very much, those are my questions.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, Mr Mansfield.
20 Questions from MR MANSFIELD
21 MR MANSFIELD: Mr Boutcher, good morning, my name is
22 Michael Mansfield and I represent the family of
23 Jean Charles de Menezes.
24 A. Good morning, sir.
25 Q. Can I just before lunch deal with one thing since you
107
1 have been asked about events afterwards. One of the
2 things that must have been foremost in your mind once
3 you realised somebody had been shot dead was: who was
4 that person.
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 Q. Because this is right up your street, if I may put it
7 that way?
8 A. Yes, sir.
9 Q. Because you are looking at leads and so on and you might
10 want to know whether the person shot was in fact one of
11 the people you were looking for or may have been. So
12 did you fast-track that inquiry?
13 A. I spoke to Mr Purser, sir, at the time, who was the
14 Silver Commander at that location, and then subsequently
15 there was a DI who is a Detective Inspector from SO13,
16 who was Mr Pover, and through him I was seeking that
17 information, sir.
18 Q. Yes. The reason I want to ask you this is that: were
19 you aware that Jean Charles de Menezes had a wallet on
20 him.
21 A. Later on that day, I was, sir, yes.
22 Q. Were you aware that the wallet was discovered very
23 shortly after he had been shot? It was on a tube train
24 seat nearby, 10.40 am in the morning. Did you know
25 that?
108
1 A. No, sir, I didn't get that information.
2 Q. You didn't get that information?
3 A. No, sir.
4 Q. Should you have been given that information?
5 A. Well, sir, because of the event that had occurred, the
6 event was then being managed by officers locally and the
7 complaints procedure occurs. I would have hoped to have
8 received as much information as I could as soon as
9 I could, but I didn't get that, and I think they are
10 dealing with the scene and the event that's occurred.
11 Q. I want to just follow through, because it may reflect on
12 what happened before, you see. You talk about the
13 complaints procedure. In fact the complaints procedure
14 didn't begin straight away, did it? It was precluded
15 from doing so?
16 A. I don't know the details of that, I am afraid, sir.
17 Q. You know it was precluded, don't you?
18 A. I don't know the detail of that at all, sir, I can't
19 give that testimony, I am sorry.
20 Q. I'm not asking for the detail. You know it was
21 precluded from entering into its investigation?
22 A. The police complaints procedure, I don't know that at
23 all, sir, no, I am sorry.
24 Q. You don't?
25 A. No.
109
1 Q. I leave that to one side for the moment. You had
2 fast-tracked this aspect, and I appreciate there are
3 lots of other aspects. It seems there are a large
4 number of officers dealing with different aspects. The
5 aspect is: who was the man who has been shot. The
6 wallet is sitting on a tube train seat at 10.40.
7 A. Right, sir.
8 Q. Did you know that the wallet contained a number of items
9 of identification?
10 A. Sir, I am trying to help you; I didn't know about the
11 wallet; I didn't know the items of identification,
12 therefore, in the wallet at that stage, no, sir.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Mr Mansfield, I am sure you can see
14 this coming. What does this have to do with the causes
15 of Mr de Menezes' death?
16 MR MANSFIELD: Because, sir, I suggest that what didn't
17 happen after, where there was a wallet and it's clear
18 with his name, date of birth and so on, was also
19 replicated in relation to rucksacks -- which I am coming
20 to -- in relation to the bombings and identification
21 there.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I am being obtuse. What do you mean?
23 MR MANSFIELD: I want to ask this officer about other items
24 of identification that were not communicated to him in
25 relation to the 21st.
110
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, I am still not sure that
2 I follow. You may take it on, but at the moment I am
3 bothered that you are going outside the legitimate range
4 of what it is this jury has to inquire into.
5 MR MANSFIELD: I appreciate that. I am being careful. In
6 fact, he has been asked just recently a large number
7 of -- well, a quantity of questions about what happened
8 later and who was arrested.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
10 MR MANSFIELD: And strictly speaking, that's got really
11 nothing --
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I thought that was simply narrative, as
13 far as Mr Hough was concerned.
14 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, it may be but then this is simply
15 narrative as well. Anyway, can I restrict it to one
16 question?
17 When did you discover that the person who was shot
18 had identification documents in the name of Jean Charles
19 de Menezes?
20 A. There is an entry in the log, sir, that I looked at the
21 following day that refers to the identity of
22 Mr de Menezes, which I will try to seek and find for
23 you. I didn't know, and if it does help, some of the
24 considerations we have, which may be relevant, often
25 people -- this was obviously a tragic death -- use
111
1 different identification documents, and in fact with one
2 of the bombers who is known by the name of Manfo Asiedu,
3 he actually took that identification from somebody in
4 a flat that he moved into, so we didn't establish that
5 actually he wasn't that individual at all. So there are
6 a lot of factors and challenges for us that we face with
7 regards to even simple identification documents, sir.
8 I wasn't informed of the detail that I think you
9 believe I should have been shortly after this incident.
10 I simply didn't know that.
11 Q. You see, I am not asking about whether it was verified.
12 It was merely when did you first, as you had
13 fast-tracked it, discover or when were you first
14 informed that he had documents on him with his name,
15 date of birth, origin and other documents, an identity
16 card he had on him; when did you first learn that?
17 A. I haven't got a record of that, sir, because that was
18 being dealt with by colleagues, and as I say, there is
19 this -- and we learn from the events in this
20 operation --
21 Q. I am sorry to intervene, I know there are problems about
22 identification.
23 A. There are, sir.
24 Q. That is understood. The question is a simple one. It's
25 not when did you verify but when did you discover that
112
1 he had documents in that name?
2 A. I haven't got a note of that, sir, and I certainly
3 wasn't told in the immediacy afterwards.
4 Q. The reason I have asked you those questions is really
5 to, as it were, examine how careful you were in relation
6 to matters surrounding the 21st. Do you follow?
7 A. I am sure I will, sir.
8 Q. I think you will. I won't manage to do it all before
9 1 o'clock. One of the things you were -- now I am going
10 back to before the shooting --
11 A. Thank you, sir.
12 Q. -- after the attempted bombings on the 21st, and I am
13 concentrating on your area of expertise, proactive,
14 there was an obvious route to possibly identifying the
15 bombers, the attempted bombers, wasn't there?
16 A. Well, if you would like to help me, Mr Mansfield.
17 Q. I just have actually earlier on by indicating why I was
18 asking the other questions. Rucksacks.
19 A. Right, sir. There was a tasking that went out which
20 I think I have referred to already to search the
21 rucksacks because of the learning of 7/7.
22 Q. Yes, I want to come to this, you see. The learning of
23 7/7, as you have indicated, was that the rucksacks on
24 that occasion, two weeks before, contained identity
25 documents which actually were referring to the people
113
1 who were the suicide bombers?
2 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
3 Q. In one case, I think the name Khan, he had documentation
4 relating to him in all the rucksacks or some of them?
5 A. A number of the scenes, sir, yes.
6 Q. All right, a number of the scenes. The reason -- well,
7 there may be many reasons, but one of the reasons why
8 that had happened on the 7th, you considered, was that
9 of course the suicide bomber may want to be remembered
10 and identified, and so therefore leaves, if you like,
11 an audit trail or at least a means of identifying, for
12 the reasons that he is doing the bombing in the first
13 place?
14 A. Some people have assessed that's the reason, yes, sir.
15 I don't think we will ever truly know.
16 Q. Right. So anyway that's part of the thinking. So when
17 you get to the 21st, with your particular responsibility
18 for proactivity, that thought must have occurred to you
19 fairly early on after the bombings which occurred
20 midday-ish?
21 A. Well, when the bombings occurred midday, I was asked to
22 put up the proactive, you know, the resources which
23 I think I have explained as well as I can, sir, and yes,
24 of course we have to make the scene safe, which takes
25 a period of time, and I am sure others can inform you
114
1 about the frustrations of actually getting access to the
2 bags because of the risks of --
3 Q. I will cut through this, really again it's about timing.
4 We know there are lots of difficulties. When did you
5 first task anybody with the, as it were, research to
6 find whether there was any identification linked to the
7 scenes or the rucksacks?
8 A. Well, the first tasking for any of that, sir, came from
9 a meeting, I think, with Mr McDowall, and forgive me
10 because I can't recall the time but I think it's
11 given --
12 Q. Yes, the time you have given so far -- I am going to cut
13 across, sorry, just to save a bit of time -- the time
14 you have given today, this morning, was 10.10 in the
15 evening?
16 A. Right, sir.
17 Q. The question I want to ask was: was that the first time
18 anybody was tasked to look for identification.
19 A. Certainly from my perspective, it was the first time
20 that I have made a note of that to occur, sir. I have
21 to say, I am sure you will appreciate, the officers
22 dealing with the scenes and the reality is, and I am
23 sure you will agree with this, making those scenes safe
24 and being able to get access to those bags does take
25 some time, and the officers performing those functions
115
1 are the same officers that dealt with the 7/7 attacks.
2 So they will be looking for all of the similarities.
3 We were trying to establish if these were linked to
4 7 July, because we simply didn't know, sir. Equally, we
5 didn't know what was going to happen the day after even
6 at that stage. So that would have been an inevitable
7 course of action for those officers to take.
8 I think my note is merely a confirmation that that's
9 being done.
10 Q. So you had had a meeting a little earlier that afternoon
11 at 5 o'clock with officers who were explaining what they
12 had found?
13 A. I think they were the explosives officers, sir, to try
14 and give us some understanding of the similarity --
15 Q. I understand that. Do you remember any of them as to
16 who they were?
17 A. They were the explosives officers, sir, the actual bomb
18 disposal experts.
19 Q. When they had their meeting, you can look at your notes,
20 and you were present?
21 A. Yes, sir.
22 Q. Did the question of identification being found at the
23 scene arise at all?
24 A. We asked, sir, for every bit of information they could
25 give us.
116
1 Q. Please answer, it will be much quicker, and I am doing
2 this because I have read your evidence in the Health and
3 Safety. Please just stick to the question. Did anyone
4 raise the issue of identification during the 5 o'clock
5 meeting?
6 A. If you let me answer, sir, I asked and others asked for
7 every bit of information that those explosives officers,
8 who aren't detectives, could give about the devices and
9 the bags.
10 Q. What's the answer to my question?
11 A. I have just given it, sir.
12 Q. Did anyone ask about identification?
13 A. Sir, I have given my answer. If you want to say three
14 years ago, do I remember specifically saying were there
15 any bank cards or driving licences or identification
16 documents in there, I don't recall. What we sought to
17 do, as I am sure you would expect us to do, was find out
18 as much as we possibly could about those devices, both
19 links to 7/7 and 21/7 and any other information that
20 would help --
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I think the answer to the question then
22 as I interpret it is no.
23 A. That I can recall specifically about that, sir, I have
24 no record of it.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You have made the point to Mr Mansfield
117
1 that these were explosives officers.
2 A. They were, sir, yes.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Bomb disposal experts because you might
4 well have had four unexploded bombs --
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: -- they were bombs, they had not gone
7 off.
8 A. Yes, sir.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: First priority, I fully understand, is
10 to make sure they are safe.
11 A. Yes, sir.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: As far as the officers you were talking
13 to, the explosives officers, would they have had any
14 responsibility, as it were, to carry out any part of
15 your proactive intelligence work?
16 A. Their responsibility, sir --
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I wish you would answer the question.
18 A. -- the devices, sir.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Sorry?
20 A. Just to the devices --
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: As I say, the answer to my question and
22 Mr Mansfield's question is no.
23 A. Sir.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Is that right?
25 A. Yes, sir.
118
1 MR MANSFIELD: Sir, would that be an appropriate moment?
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you. 2 o'clock. Would you like
3 to go on, members of the jury; there is something I want
4 to sort out about documentation. Please carry on.
5 (In the absence of the jury)
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I just want to be clear what the jury
7 have and haven't got, Mr Hough. In the course of your
8 examination-in-chief of this witness, you were putting
9 up on the screen a different set of logs, surveillance
10 logs.
11 MR HOUGH: The surveillance running log, which is the
12 print-out, as I understand it, from what was coming up
13 on the screen as the surveillance monitors were typing
14 it in.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: They were paginated. My bundle stops
16 at page 230.
17 MR HOUGH: They don't appear in the jury's bundles.
18 I wasn't proposing to put them in there at this stage
19 because we have surveillance monitors and the like
20 coming on.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I only wanted to be clear what the jury
22 had. I thought my bundle might have gone short.
23 MR HOUGH: You are absolutely right, and your bundle is up
24 to date.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: 2 o'clock, ladies and gentlemen.
119
1 (1.00 pm)
2 (The short adjournment)
3 (2.00 pm)
4 (In the presence of the jury)
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Mr Mansfield, just to help with the
6 timetabling, do you think you are going to be able to
7 finish this witness this afternoon?
8 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you, that will be helpful.
10 MR MANSFIELD: Now, Mr Boutcher, I want to start this
11 afternoon by asking you a question which I have asked
12 already of Mr McDowall, and I will only ask of very
13 senior officers in relation to this operation.
14 You gave evidence at the Health and Safety trial
15 last year?
16 A. Yes, sir.
17 Q. We know that you have made a statement, tape recording,
18 a decision log, and so on. So it's right to say, isn't
19 it, you have had a lot of time to reflect on the tragic
20 events of the 22nd?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Now, the question is this: on reflection, what do you
23 think went wrong with the operation?
24 A. On reflection, sir, inevitably that's happened. I am
25 not sure anything did actually go wrong. Without
120
1 apportioning blame to anybody, the way the events
2 emerged and the identification and the efforts to arrest
3 Mr de Menezes, I think if they occurred today, this
4 afternoon, the difference would be that we now have,
5 that we would have recorded the firearms briefing, audio
6 recorded the firearms briefing. We now have audio
7 recording in the control room, two different types of
8 recording, ambient noise recording devices. We would
9 have a recording of the surveillance channel, so the
10 activity on the surveillance channel would be recorded.
11 And we have recording in the control room of the
12 telephone lines, so the communications with the
13 Silver Commander would all have been recorded.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: If you pause there a minute, I am not
15 sure that's answering the question. I can understand
16 that that's something that's been introduced, but that
17 merely means that what has happened is much easier to
18 identify. What the question was is what do you think
19 went wrong?
20 A. I don't think anything went wrong, sir, I don't.
21 I think we are not able to recapture the events to show
22 exactly what happened because of human memory and
23 note-taking, but I can't see anything that we could have
24 done that would have changed the course of the tragedy
25 of Mr de Menezes.
121
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well.
2 MR MANSFIELD: On that basis, there is a real risk, then, it
3 could happen again.
4 A. There is, sir, yes.
5 Q. I am going to go through with you some areas which
6 I suggest, when looked at not with hindsight but with
7 foresight, are areas which were predictable and which,
8 if had been handled quite differently, would have led to
9 a different result. Do you follow?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. I just want to deal with areas where I suggest that
12 could happen, since you don't think anything went wrong.
13 It might be sensible if we work, in your case,
14 backwards, as it were, from the moment of the shooting.
15 I am going to deal with the immediate events that led up
16 to it in an attempt to begin to identify some of the
17 things surrounding the immediate shooting. All right?
18 A. Yes, sir.
19 Q. Now, at 9.34, you had information, and you can have your
20 statement or any other document you wish, if you wish to
21 open the statement --
22 A. Thank you, sir.
23 Q. -- the place in your statement is obviously much later.
24 It's paragraph 28 onwards if you want to look at that.
25 A. Thank you, sir.
122
1 Q. All right?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Now, the context for this sequence of events, in
4 a sense, you have already put your finger on it.
5 Identification is a notoriously difficult area, isn't
6 it?
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 Q. I wonder -- I don't know whether you can be heard all
9 right.
10 A. Sorry. Yes, sir.
11 Q. If you put the microphone a little closer.
12 So you have agreed it's a notoriously difficult
13 area, and that juries in criminal trials and in other
14 trials but certainly in criminal ones, are warned very
15 carefully by the trial judge about the dangers of
16 misidentification, aren't they?
17 A. Yes, sir.
18 Q. And officers such as yourself are only too well aware of
19 the dangers of misidentification, aren't you?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. Now, on operations such as this, the surveillance
22 officers themselves would be very aware of the dangers
23 of misidentification?
24 A. Yes, sir.
25 Q. So would the firearms officers; is that right?
123
1 A. All officers are aware of it, sir, yes.
2 Q. You see, because I'm going to go straight in on an area
3 which is, I suggest, one of the main areas that led to
4 the death: he was misidentified. That's fairly clear,
5 isn't it?
6 A. Yes, sir.
7 Q. That's one of the things that went wrong, isn't it?
8 A. The identification was incorrect, sir, yes.
9 Q. It led to certain decisions. You have already indicated
10 that, in fact, it's particularly difficult when you are
11 dealing with a subject -- because I think that's the
12 term you use for the suspect -- the subject of the
13 surveillance is not known to those who are doing the
14 surveillance; that makes it a little more difficult,
15 doesn't it?
16 A. Yes, sir, the first day particularly of an operation
17 with the surveillance team, it's even more challenging,
18 obviously.
19 Q. Right. Now, it would not be unfair to say that if you
20 are going to be briefing -- and you have done briefings,
21 I presume?
22 A. I have, sir, yes.
23 Q. Many times, and I think you said in the Health and
24 Safety you had done something like, what, 200 armed
25 operations?
124
1 A. Around 100, probably, sir.
2 Q. When it comes to a briefing, one of the things the
3 briefing officers -- and you have put in your notes
4 about the need for a proper briefing, that's obvious,
5 isn't it? You have to have a proper briefing?
6 A. As good a briefing as possible, sir, yes.
7 Q. Yes. One of the things you need to be able to convey
8 every time somebody goes out if identification is going
9 to be the threshold for action, is care?
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 Q. Is that fair? I know it's rather obvious.
12 A. Care in the briefing, sir?
13 Q. Well, the briefing has to be careful and the officer
14 doing the briefing has to say for the surveillance
15 officers: you are there to identify or not, we have to
16 take decisions based on that or not, so we need for you
17 to be particularly careful as we don't know this person
18 and in fact we have only got one image, possibly two
19 from a CCTV, and some of you won't even have it with
20 you. Now, in those circumstances, surveillance officers
21 do really have to be extremely careful what they say,
22 don't they?
23 A. They have a very difficult job, sir.
24 Q. They do, and I accept that, extremely difficult job.
25 Because often surveillance, in order to identify, takes
125
1 place over a much longer period when it's somebody you
2 don't know?
3 A. Yes, sir, yes.
4 Q. Right. I appreciate it's quicker when you know the
5 person. Now, the firearms officers, when they are being
6 briefed, this was a MASTS operation, in one sense,
7 wasn't it?
8 A. Yes, sir.
9 Q. Just to remind the jury, that's a term, an acronym that
10 you use to convey to others that it's mobile armed
11 support for surveillance?
12 A. For surveillance, yes, sir.
13 Q. Right, so surveillance in a sense comes first. It's the
14 trigger, and the platform perhaps is more ready
15 explanation, that's the platform, the CO19 are coming in
16 on the back of whatever surveillance sees, and of course
17 direction from a central officer.
18 So that the firearms, who are also being given the
19 same image, have to be warned to be very careful about
20 what they do in relation to somebody and their
21 identification, don't they?
22 A. Yeah, they receive a set number of warnings in effect,
23 sir, in the briefing.
24 Q. Right. Of course the problem with -- and I am not
25 dealing with you in the actual briefings because you
126
1 weren't there -- of course following a formula briefing
2 is that people don't necessarily take it on board. It's
3 rather like safety instructions on an aircraft. People
4 often don't listen to what's being said because they
5 think they know. So there is a problem, isn't there,
6 about ensuring that care is communicated and even with
7 professionals that it's taken on board?
8 A. I think if I may, sir, in this event, because of what
9 happened on the -- in that time in July, I think
10 everybody was very careful with regards to those
11 responsibilities.
12 Q. Right, well, when we get to the officers, obviously this
13 is an avenue we will have to examine with the officers.
14 You accept all of that as a precursor for this
15 situation?
16 A. Yes, sir.
17 Q. Of course the other aspect of this, that the officers on
18 surveillance as well as SO or CO19, is of course the
19 suicide bomber, can I put them in that term, may not
20 actually be at this address at all?
21 A. Absolutely, sir, yes.
22 Q. In fact, your personal view, I think, was that, what,
23 probably they won't be because it was a footprint
24 address?
25 A. I had an open mind, sir, but my expectation, my fear was
127
1 they would have gone to another address that we would
2 find more difficult to find to reorganise to attack us.
3 That was my priority.
4 Q. Almost, as you thought, that was right?
5 A. Between that and my second fear about fleeing, yes, sir.
6 Q. Yes, and that as well. So you would have to be making
7 sure that the officers who are going out on the street
8 are not in the mindset, "we are going to see a suicide
9 bomber" but in the mindset, "there might be, there might
10 not, we have to be careful"; is that fair?
11 A. That's fair, sir, yes.
12 Q. So that's the second area. Did you in fact, just to get
13 this as again a precondition for this sequence of events
14 after you really come back from the hotel through to the
15 shooting itself, were you involved in any way in
16 advising on briefings or not?
17 A. On advising on them, sir, sorry?
18 Q. Yes, the contents of them?
19 A. No, I was very focused because of Andrew's request about
20 the photographs, to make sure, because I know the
21 importance of that, that the latest photographs, the
22 best -- and that's a living process, they may get better
23 CCTV imagery photographs through the period of the
24 trawl, if you will, that they had the best photographs
25 available for the briefing, and the intelligence had
128
1 obviously emerged in the night during my absence.
2 Q. I think there was one other aspect besides wanting the
3 best photographs available, because it stands to reason
4 that somebody who's going out to look for somebody they
5 haven't ever met before or seen before, you need to have
6 clearly the best images you can get of the person they
7 are looking for?
8 A. Yes, the CCTV images, that's correct, that's what I was
9 focused upon.
10 Q. I appreciate that. In addition to that, I think you
11 made a note in your book, or somewhere, anyway, that it
12 would be desirable to have an explosives officer from
13 SO13 attend Leman Street to give the SO19 officers
14 a clear idea of the kind of devices that may confront
15 them?
16 A. That was a request from Andrew, sir, yes.
17 Q. I am sorry, all right, from Andrew. Did that happen?
18 A. It was put in place, sir, because of the events as they
19 occurred. I can't answer that, I am afraid. I don't
20 know if it did or not.
21 Q. So you can't help me as to whether an explosives officer
22 from SO13 went to Leman Street?
23 A. No, I wasn't part then of the briefing, sir.
24 Q. I can't --
25 A. It was put in place. Whether it occurred or not,
129
1 I don't know.
2 Q. Those are some of the precursors before, and I said
3 I would deal with the immediate events just before the
4 shooting. So at 9.34 and you have the paragraph there,
5 Pat says words to the effect -- I mean, what does Pat
6 say at this point?
7 A. Are we going to 9.34, sir, sorry?
8 Q. Yes, I am going straight to the crucial period first of
9 all, please.
10 A. Could you assist me with the paragraph again? Sorry,
11 Mr Mansfield.
12 Q. Yes, the paragraphs that deal with this are on my
13 page 46, and it's paragraph 27.
14 A. I have it, yes, thank you.
15 Q. I know pages and paragraphs can differ. You will see
16 9.34 is there. I am not expecting you now to remember
17 off the top of your head what he said, but it may be
18 quite important, do you see, because I'm going to
19 suggest to you one of the other problems here, besides
20 the briefings which touched on with you, is of course
21 how information is relayed to the control room; all
22 right?
23 A. Yes, sir.
24 Q. We will learn that what Frank actually said is one
25 thing, but what is your note of what you heard from Pat,
130
1 the surveillance monitor?
2 A. I have that Pat said that a man possibly identical with
3 Hussain Osman had left the Scotia Road address at 9.34.
4 Q. Well, that actually wasn't what the person on the ground
5 said; did you know that?
6 A. No, sir, I don't hear that. There is the headset
7 system.
8 Q. I want to come straight to this point: you see, one of
9 the things that went wrong that particular morning
10 was -- and I want to come through what information you
11 got and where you got it from -- that there was too much
12 going on in that control room, information coming in
13 from different sources with different people on mobiles
14 and headsets, and with confused information being
15 relayed; is that a fair description?
16 A. That's not fair at all, sir, no.
17 Q. You don't think so?
18 A. No, I disagree with that.
19 Q. Even looking back on it now?
20 A. Very much so, sir, and we had five firearms teams out
21 subsequently run from a control room, so I don't agree
22 with that.
23 Q. I appreciate, I am just dealing with this incident,
24 I have specifically asked you what went wrong, you said
25 basically nothing, and I want to deal with this. Then
131
1 the first bit of information, actually what Frank will
2 tell this jury, Frank being in the van opposite the
3 door, or near the door with a view of the communal door,
4 at least those coming from it, was that he was worth
5 a second look.
6 Now, that wasn't conveyed to you in those terms, was
7 it?
8 A. It wasn't, sir, no.
9 Q. What I want to suggest to you is that if you are going
10 to have a system which you devised for that day whereby
11 a DSO a long way from the scene in New Scotland Yard is
12 going to have to take critical decisions about who to
13 follow, because either they are not a suspect but worth
14 following, or who to, as it were, intervene with because
15 they are a suspect or they are possibly a suspect, it's
16 all going to hinge on the reliability of identification,
17 isn't it?
18 A. The identification is obviously important, sir, yes.
19 Q. It's going to hinge on it to start with, isn't it?
20 A. As to whether we follow a person, obviously, sir, yes.
21 Q. The problem that day was that there was in fact at the
22 stage that Frank alerted the control room via Pat, that
23 there was not, as it were, an audio channel; in other
24 words, you say to the control room "Shh", and everybody
25 can either hear or see exactly what the surveillance
132
1 team are saying.
2 Do you follow?
3 A. I understand your point, sir, yes.
4 Q. That wasn't in place, was it?
5 A. You can play the surveillance, sir. At that time Pat
6 had his headphones on, so Pat is hearing the
7 surveillance. But we are in operations room where we
8 are in two surveillance operations which I understand
9 your point, sir, that escalates to more, so you are not
10 able to do that with the different surveillance
11 channels.
12 Q. Right. What I want to suggest is, and I am not doing
13 this with hindsight because you had had a little
14 exercise a few days before. If you have got two
15 exercises running in parallel or tandem, however you
16 want to put it, one at Scotia Road and one at
17 Portnall Road, you may need quite separate -- and
18 I don't know what you want to call them -- control units
19 or control pods within New Scotland Yard so that the
20 same person isn't having to deal with simultaneous
21 information that's coming in.
22 Is that a fair point?
23 A. Unfortunately not from my perspective, sir, no, because
24 during these operations you need to have a single person
25 responsible from that control function, and it might be
133
1 you need to -- one event has a significant effect on
2 another event. You need a single control room, sir.
3 Q. All right. But I think you agree that what did not
4 happen here was Commander Dick or you or somebody saying
5 to the control room in whatever language they want to
6 use, "Just shut up for a minute, let's us listen to
7 what's being said", because this is the first time -- in
8 fact by this stage obviously Portnall Road is being
9 covered --
10 A. Yes, sir, it was.
11 Q. -- at 9.34, and there doesn't appear to be, as far as
12 we know, crucial messages coming through from
13 Portnall Road at that point. So for Dick to say, "Shut
14 up", so that she can have a direct link to the
15 information rather than it coming through either Pat or
16 one of the Trojans or you or someone else. Do you
17 follow the point?
18 A. I follow your point, sir, absolutely. Pat had the
19 headsets on and was listening to it, as you know.
20 Commander Dick was then in touch with Mr Purser direct
21 on the telephone to get an information update from him,
22 but I absolutely understand your point.
23 Q. The reason I am putting it to you is, as the jury will
24 again hear over the course of the next two to
25 three weeks, is that people have serious disagreements
134
1 about what was said. You do know that now?
2 A. I know that now, sir, yes.
3 Q. You may not agree with what some are saying, but on the
4 other hand this is one of the problems. So Pat says,
5 according to you, "possibly identical". Can we move on,
6 because the next stage is quite important.
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 Q. I think you have noted, and if you want the paragraph,
9 since you are following from your statement, I am moving
10 to the next stage, which is at 28.
11 A. Thank you, sir.
12 Q. Paragraph 28, all right?
13 A. Yes, thank you.
14 Q. If I'm going too fast, please say. This is the stage
15 which you described before lunch as where you are told
16 in the control room that he is not believed to be Osman,
17 effectively?
18 A. Yes, sir, that's correct.
19 Q. This is quite important, this is a negative, and it
20 triggers the possibility, as happened here, of an order
21 via you. Now, who told you that he absolutely wasn't or
22 was believed to be not, or whatever the words were used?
23 Who told you, first of all, before we get to what words?
24 A. Chief Inspector Esposito, sir, who was the tactical
25 adviser.
135
1 Q. He is not on the ground, is he?
2 A. No, sir, he is listening to the monitoring, similar to
3 Pat.
4 Q. So you would want to check, since it's second-hand at
5 the very least and possibly third, whether that is
6 right?
7 A. Sir.
8 Q. There is a way of doing that, isn't there? Was a way,
9 sorry.
10 A. I am assuming that's done, sir, because we have then got
11 Dingemans going forward and contacting the surveillance
12 team to go and stop him.
13 Q. All right, I'll come to how this could have been handled
14 quite differently in a moment. So you say it's
15 Trojan 80 who tells you it's not?
16 A. Esposito, sir, yes.
17 Q. Sorry, Esposito.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's the same chap.
19 MR MANSFIELD: It's the same person.
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. It's just he is referred to in that way in some of the
22 documents, so the jury can follow as well.
23 So it's Trojan 80 or Esposito who tells you that,
24 and then you use the bolt-on team. Now, that's the
25 Dingemans team, because they are there with a dual role,
136
1 one of which is pursue people for information or
2 intelligence?
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. When was he deployed?
5 A. By "deployed", sir?
6 Q. Sorry. When did you ask -- I think you have given, so
7 I will leave times with you. You have indicated to us
8 that you spoke to your deputy, Angela Scott, at
9 an earlier time after the 7 o'clock meeting?
10 A. Oh, right, sir, yes.
11 Q. Right?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. About the possibility, well, more than that, you spoke
14 to her and she's told us what she did, she goes to
15 Dingemans or rings him up or whatever she does, speaks
16 to Dingemans: we need a back-up bolt-on -- she didn't
17 use that term -- but back-up team of SO13 unarmed
18 officers down there in case there are people we need to
19 pursue for intelligence; right?
20 A. She was asked to do that, yes, sir.
21 Q. And she did that. So somewhere after 7.15, 7.30 in the
22 morning, they have been effectively briefed, or
23 Mr Dingemans has, by Angela Scott. Now, do you know
24 when that team actually got to Scotia Road?
25 A. I don't, sir, no.
137
1 Q. No. When you gave the order, is it, that the Dingemans
2 team go into action, did you have a clue as to where
3 they were?
4 A. Where they were, sir, no, I didn't.
5 Q. No. This is a little unsatisfactory, isn't it?
6 A. No, sir. They had been given a responsibility and
7 a role. My expectation is that they will be in the
8 vicinity of or close to the surveillance team to conduct
9 that task.
10 Q. I suggest -- it may not be your particular
11 responsibility, and I am not suggesting it is, to
12 monitor exactly where they are, but of course things can
13 go wrong. They could have broken down on the way,
14 couldn't they?
15 A. Had they done that, sir, and they weren't able to comply
16 with their task, I would hope they would let us know and
17 we would get somebody else to do it.
18 Q. You would hope that, wouldn't you? Do you now know
19 where they were at 9.34?
20 A. No, sir, I don't, exactly, no.
21 Q. When you say nothing went wrong, you have not really
22 apprised yourself of all the detail of this operation,
23 have you?
24 A. No, I have, sir. I still don't see how something has
25 gone wrong yet, sir.
138
1 Q. Because Dingemans was nowhere near being able at 9.34 to
2 intercept this person or pursue this person because he
3 was at Nightingale Lane still?
4 A. Forgive me, Mr Mansfield, how would that have made
5 a difference?
6 Q. You know where Scotia Road is, you know that area?
7 A. I do, sir, yes.
8 Q. You know where Nightingale Lane is?
9 A. Yes, sir, I do.
10 Q. You know the premises in Nightingale Lane?
11 A. Yes, I do.
12 Q. Right, and you know in the rush hour between 8 and 10 in
13 the morning, 8 and 9.30 in the morning, the journey
14 between Nightingale Lane and Scotia Road, or the number
15 2 bus because he has got on that by then, is a difficult
16 journey, isn't it?
17 A. I can't comment on that, sir, I am just wondering if
18 Dingemans -- my understanding is then, sir, the subject
19 is on the bus?
20 Q. That's right. Well, we don't know precisely but he is
21 probably on the bus at that point.
22 A. So, sir, if the subject is probably on the bus and
23 Dingemans has been asked to go and support the
24 surveillance team to do an intelligence stop when he
25 gets off the bus, Dingemans goes from Nightingale --
139
1 which is within a couple of miles of Scotia Road, as
2 a guess, sir, I couldn't be precise -- and supports the
3 surveillance team to conduct that stop.
4 Q. The problem was, he had to do catch-up and he couldn't
5 catch up. Did you know that?
6 A. I don't think Mr de Menezes had got off the bus at that
7 stage. I have not seen the timeline for this, sir,
8 obviously, but from your point I am not quite with you,
9 clearly.
10 Q. No. All right. To return to base, as it were. You
11 don't know when you make that order where that team is,
12 and it may not matter so much at that stage that you
13 didn't know where he was, but the later, I suggest,
14 does. Can we move on from sending them in.
15 Now, the next stage, and again you can follow it
16 from your statement, is that he boards the bus again at
17 Brixton and now he's believed at some point to be Osman;
18 all right?
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 Q. What's the wording that's used now and who says it?
21 A. I have at 28, sir, that I was then informed that the
22 subject had exited Scotia Road -- forgive me, I am at
23 the wrong section, we have moved on.
24 Q. It's a little later than that. It's when you then ask
25 for a percentage?
140
1 A. Yes, sir.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: 29.
3 A. Thank you, sir.
4 Pat informed me that the subject was believed to be
5 Hussain Osman.
6 MR MANSFIELD: Right. This is very important, isn't it,
7 this one, because as a result of that you call off
8 Dingemans, who hasn't actually got there anyway, and you
9 are asking for a percentage and so on. So we are now at
10 that stage.
11 A. Yes, that's right, sir.
12 Q. So the position is now switching to the firearms team,
13 isn't it?
14 A. Yes, sir.
15 Q. Right. You didn't know where the Dingemans team was;
16 did you know where the firearms team was?
17 A. Exact location of them, sir, no.
18 Q. Was there in the room something which I am going to
19 suggest was terribly simple to do, was a map on the
20 wall? Was there?
21 A. There wasn't, sir, no.
22 Q. It's not so difficult, is it?
23 A. Again, sir, with the number of deployments that we have
24 in these operations, it's simple looking at this and it
25 is hindsight, sir, at one address, it's not as
141
1 simplistic as you say.
2 Q. No, I am not suggesting it's simple. I am suggesting
3 it's straightforward to have on the wall -- you have two
4 addresses that this operation, at this point --
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 Q. -- okay, at this point, so that you actually can place
7 on the map, even with your eye if not something else,
8 and track the movements of subjects that are really
9 interesting, because they are suspects?
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 Q. All right? And the positions of surveillance where you
12 need to, and the positions of firearms where you need
13 to. That really is straightforward, isn't it?
14 A. It is, sir. If it helps, if I want to know where the
15 firearms team are located at any stage, I would simply
16 ask the senior tactical adviser, who would be able to
17 tell me, similarly with the surveillance teams, who is
18 in the room, sir.
19 Q. Unless you know the area very well, you happen to?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. But you can't be assured that everybody else knows the
22 area very well in that control room, do you?
23 A. No.
24 Q. So you don't know where Dingemans is, you don't know
25 where SO19 are at the point at which, in a fast-moving,
142
1 obviously, situation, that it's now thought that it is
2 Osman. I want to ask you this carefully: Pat --
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. -- told you this; right?
5 A. Yes, he did, sir.
6 Q. You are quite sure that that's what he said?
7 A. I am sir, yes.
8 Q. Do you know what he says about this?
9 A. I don't know the exact words he now uses, sir, no.
10 Q. You don't. Well, I want to put two points to you so you
11 know where they come from. He doesn't recall ever
12 saying that; do you follow?
13 A. I do, sir.
14 Q. Could you be wrong?
15 A. No, sir. Why would we then change from the position of
16 Mr Dingemans doing the stop, sir, to the firearms
17 officers doing the stop?
18 Q. Because I suggest everything wasn't quite as calm and
19 collected as you say it was.
20 A. Sir, I have run a number of these operations. It was
21 energetic, focused. There was certainly no confusion,
22 no doubt with regards to what Pat said at all, and
23 because of what he said, and then we changed the
24 response of the firearms team and Dingemans, with
25 everybody there, it led to that chain of events.
143
1 Q. Yes. Well, I just want to read you a very short
2 description from Pat himself in relation to this very
3 stage where he's being asked by you to get a clearer
4 assessment of the identification:
5 "Although the noise level in the room did drop, it
6 was still such that communicating with the senior
7 officers was by shouting across the room."
8 Is that right?
9 A. That is absolutely incorrect, sir.
10 Q. I see. Could we have, please, since we have got to
11 again, as it were, another crucial stage, the running
12 log in the operations room, 447. Could we just have it
13 back on screen for a moment. You have seen it. In fact
14 I think you have said today that you have not seen this
15 before?
16 A. Yes, sir.
17 Q. Well, what is the point of this log in the operations
18 room?
19 A. It's for any significant event with regards to
20 a particular surveillance operation to be recorded by
21 the monitor.
22 Q. Yes, for whose benefit?
23 A. Well, for everybody's benefit, sir.
24 Q. Yes, including yourself, and including the DSO
25 Cressida Dick, isn't it?
144
1 A. It is, sir, but again if I can explain, I can hear Pat
2 quite clearly, I don't need to look at this log, I was
3 there communicating with Pat, standing very closely to
4 Cressida Dick. The log would assist me more readily
5 when I come in in the morning to see any significant
6 events that have occurred, because this isn't like
7 a normal surveillance log which includes everything;
8 this is very much just key events.
9 So I can look at the surveillance logs to make sure
10 that I am satisfied that, if you like, we have not
11 missed anything; there is not something there that would
12 be pertinent to the investigation that I know about and
13 others don't realise, but at the time in the ops room,
14 I am not going from this log, I am listening directly to
15 Pat.
16 Q. We have a number of different people all listening to
17 different conversations, haven't we?
18 A. I can't account for other people, sir. I am listening
19 to Pat and I can clearly hear what he says, sir.
20 Q. You recognised yourself in this very critical period,
21 one, that identification is difficult; you were asking
22 for assessments; and you don't look at the log to see
23 whether there is any help there because of course it's
24 "unidentified male" all the way through, isn't it?
25 A. Again, sir, with this log, this is Pat's log -- sorry,
145
1 sir, the surveillance is obviously the element at the
2 front end on the ground. This isn't what was
3 necessarily said. It's Pat's reflection of what he can
4 hear.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, but it's Pat who is actually
6 speaking directly to the surveillance team?
7 A. It is, sir, and if I may, to me, so at the time I am not
8 checking the log.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's a different point. Pat's
10 recording in his surveillance running log represents
11 what he heard from the surveillance team.
12 A. It should do, sir, yes.
13 MR MANSFIELD: I am going to move forward. You don't look
14 at that. You say Pat tells you it's believed to be him,
15 and according to what you said this morning, you then
16 ask Esposito about the firearms team moving forward; is
17 that right.
18 A. I believe so, sir, yes, that's correct.
19 Q. Did you know where the firearms team were then?
20 A. No, I didn't, sir.
21 Q. Did you ask Esposito when he said they weren't in
22 a position to move in at that point, did you say, "Well,
23 where on earth are they?"
24 A. Can I just clarify something, sir? I do know that the
25 firearms team have gone to Nightingale Lane. I know
146
1 they are in the area. As to the fact where specifically
2 their cars are, I don't know. I know they are there,
3 sir.
4 Q. But, you see, we have been to the area. Knowing that
5 they are in the area, I suggest to you, is just totally
6 inadequate. If you are dealing with a team that might
7 end up delivering a critical shot or at least some form
8 of armed intervention, I suggest the control room needs
9 to know exactly where they are if you are going to order
10 them into action?
11 A. I don't accept that, sir, at all, I really don't. The
12 important thing is that the team are in the locality and
13 then running these operations and working in London with
14 firearms deployments, you could be secreted anywhere,
15 and for the operations room to be expected to know where
16 each covert armed response vehicle is -- is beyond
17 ambitious, sir.
18 Q. There is only three.
19 A. For the number of teams that we have, sir --
20 Q. No, sorry, for Scotia Road, how many mobile teams?
21 A. Teams, sir? You mean vehicles?
22 Q. Yes.
23 A. In the team for Scotia Road, altogether the vehicles
24 roughly numbered about five, I would have thought.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: No, you misunderstood. How many teams?
147
1 There was the red surveillance team, the grey
2 surveillance team, and the black firearms team. They
3 were the ones involved.
4 A. They would each have five vehicles, sir. So my point is
5 that what you are asking, Mr Mansfield, is simply
6 unachievable.
7 MR MANSFIELD: I see, unachievable, but what you could have
8 asked, very simply, since it's unachievable, according
9 to you, to plot where the firearms team are, you don't
10 even say to Esposito: well, where are they.
11 A. I don't recall saying that, sir.
12 Q. Why not?
13 A. Because I knew they were going to be -- having again
14 been in the operation, sir, they are going to be getting
15 into a position, making ground, to get with the
16 surveillance team. They might be very close to them.
17 Q. They might be anywhere, mightn't they, and in fact as we
18 will come to in a moment, you made a very serious
19 misassumption as to where the stop was going to take
20 place, didn't you?
21 A. I believed it would take place in the mouth of the tube
22 station, sir.
23 Q. Why did you believe that?
24 A. Because Esposito said they were in a position to do it,
25 sir.
148
1 Q. What did that convey to you? Because you didn't know
2 where they were?
3 A. No, I didn't, sir, but by that comment from Mr Esposito,
4 I assessed that the team were going to be in a position
5 to conduct the arrest, which means they are there to do
6 it.
7 Q. This is something else that went wrong; they weren't in
8 a position, you know that now?
9 A. I know that now, sir.
10 Q. That went wrong, didn't it?
11 A. Again, sir, you can't have -- the arrest team can't sit
12 on top of the surveillance team. There is always going
13 to be a period of time, and without, you know, we
14 know --
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The trouble is this -- sorry,
16 Mr Mansfield -- you accept that when Commander Dick was
17 told that the firearms team was in a position to make
18 the stop.
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That was wrong.
21 A. Yes, sir.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: If Commander Dick had not been given
23 that information, she would not have changed her
24 instructions, would she?
25 A. No, sir. Yes, sir.
149
1 MR MANSFIELD: You said no and yes. I am not sure which bit
2 you are saying it to.
3 If we have got to the stage at which she is being
4 told that the firearms team are in a position --
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 Q. -- her instructions, actually your suggestion, remember,
7 your suggestion has been firstly they are not in
8 a position, so therefore we had better use surveillance
9 officers?
10 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
11 Q. And an order goes out, surveillance?
12 A. That's correct, sir.
13 Q. Right? And if in fact you had been properly informed at
14 that point that the armed officers were not in
15 a position to do anything, then the armed surveillance,
16 having been given the order, and they had asked if they
17 could do that as well. Did you know that?
18 A. I am aware of that subsequently, sir.
19 Q. They asked if they could do it. Have you seen the
20 compilation video that the jury have seen or film of the
21 sequence of events leading up to --
22 A. No, sir.
23 Q. You have not seen it. Can I very quickly put to you
24 that what that compilation demonstrates very clearly is
25 that the surveillance officers, Ivor and so on, Ken, are
150
1 there in the position you imagined that the armed
2 officers were, they were there to do the stop but they
3 were prevented from doing it through misinformation?
4 A. Yes, sir, I see that.
5 Q. Right. Now that went wrong, didn't it?
6 A. Yes, sir, I see. I agree with that.
7 Q. Now, I just want to do the final order that comes from
8 Cressida Dick, you have made very clear, was not the
9 delivery of a critical shot but was to detain,
10 effectively?
11 A. Yes, sir.
12 Q. I am sorry to ask you again, but are you able to help,
13 was it the word "detain" or was it the word "stop" or
14 you do not know?
15 A. I can't recall now.
16 Q. Anyway a word to that effect?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. Another problem here was, of course, what those
19 listening to the order may think she means?
20 A. Potentially, sir, yes.
21 Q. Potentially. Now, I just want to rewind for a moment.
22 So we have firearms officers who were actually not in
23 a position and they have to rush over the barriers and
24 down the escalator and so on. Going back to their
25 briefing?
151
1 A. Yes, sir.
2 Q. You were not there, but elements of it you do know about
3 because you were a party to the decisions.
4 First of all, what they know is, from the briefing,
5 that a DSO is handling this whole operation?
6 A. Yes, they should have, sir, yes.
7 Q. Of course they should. Do you know whether in fact
8 anyone at the briefing said: although there is a DSO,
9 this is actually rather novel; we have not had a DSO
10 handle the whole operation; it doesn't mean there is
11 a suicide bomber, but it means that she is handling it
12 or he, whoever is the DSO, start to finish, not just the
13 critical shot. That's what they should be told?
14 A. I wasn't at the briefing, Mr Mansfield, so I can't help
15 on that.
16 Q. But you appreciate the problem here, that if a firearms
17 officer is told that the DSO is handling it and the DSO
18 says stop, when a DSO normally, in the other, you know,
19 exercises before, is only employed in a Clydesdale
20 set-up?
21 A. Clydesdale and Kratos, sir.
22 Q. Well, not Kratos.
23 A. No, they are, sir.
24 Q. They are now, but then?
25 A. They were actually before as well, sir. Kratos People,
152
1 Kratos Vehicles.
2 Q. I appreciate Kratos sometimes gets elided into both.
3 I will use the term across the board. What they would
4 know then is that a DSO is associated with
5 a Kratos/Clydesdale operation?
6 A. They would, sir, yes.
7 Q. Besides that, as it were, influence on their thinking,
8 there is another important difference on this occasion;
9 that the ammunition being used and authorised was
10 exceptional, wasn't it?
11 A. It was, sir, yes.
12 Q. You were a party to that. When that was authorised,
13 were you aware that in fact it had not in fact been
14 authorised by the Home Office?
15 A. No, I was informed that it was approved ammunition and
16 it's the, forgive me, the expertise in this area, sir,
17 but it's the chief officer who authorises the ammunition
18 for the police force, so the chief officer for the Met
19 would have authorised it.
20 Q. That element of whether it was authorised or whether it
21 was lawful, that didn't enter your thinking at all?
22 A. It did, because I spoke to [name redacted] about that.
23 That is why I clarified that --
24 Q. Did anybody say to you there could be a human rights
25 problem?
153
1 A. Absolutely not, sir, no.
2 Q. Because it may cause unnecessary suffering?
3 A. No, sir, not at all. I think I have rationalised why we
4 used the ammunition.
5 Q. I fully understand why you used the ammunition and your
6 reasoning. But of course that being the reasoning,
7 that's another powerful factor for a firearms officer,
8 and some of them refuse to take it. Did you know that?
9 A. I didn't, sir, no.
10 Q. It's a powerful factor that they have got a DSO on
11 board, controlling the whole thing?
12 A. Yes, sir.
13 Q. From about 7.15 onwards, and they are being given
14 specialised ammunition?
15 A. They are, sir.
16 Q. Now, in addition to that, I want to ask you about
17 a number of factors before that sequence 9.34 onwards,
18 and that this is the period, so it's clear to you, and
19 you can go backwards, I said I would go backwards in
20 your statement, effectively?
21 A. Thank you, sir.
22 Q. When you come back on duty at 7 in the morning?
23 A. Yes, sir, 7.10, sir.
24 Q. And you have been at a nearby hotel?
25 A. Yes, sir.
154
1 Q. The paragraph that I am dealing with is paragraph 16
2 onwards. I am sorry, the jury don't have the statement.
3 A. Thank you.
4 Q. They are just points. First of all, when you came back,
5 were you surprised that no-one had telephoned you at the
6 hotel, because you had asked to be telephoned, if there
7 were developments, that no-one had telephoned you at the
8 hotel with the information about identity which was
9 something which you would be interested in. Were you
10 surprised at that?
11 A. I was surprised not to be called, sir.
12 Q. Were you even more surprised to discover that while you
13 were writing out the firearms authority before you went
14 to the hotel, that the loggist for Mr McDowall had noted
15 that Scotia Road was related to a gym card found in
16 a rucksack?
17 A. Yes, sir.
18 Q. Because what should have happened here is you should
19 have been told, before you went off duty: we have got
20 a gym card with this address and this name.
21 A. Yes, sir.
22 Q. I asked Mr Forteath what he did with it, and he wasn't
23 really able to help us about what he did with it, but he
24 certainly didn't give it to you. If you had been told
25 at, let us say, 2.20 am when you were still at New
155
1 Scotland Yard that they had a gym card, would you have
2 decided to stay?
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. Right. Now, that's quite important, I suggest to you,
5 because if you had stayed, you would have fast-tracked
6 quite a lot of intelligence leads in relation to that
7 name, and so on, wouldn't you?
8 A. I wasn't there, sir. I believe that was done in my
9 absence.
10 Q. Yes.
11 A. I wasn't there.
12 Q. I know you weren't there.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The information didn't actually come in
14 until 4.20.
15 MR MANSFIELD: No, sir, it was Forteath who said he had the
16 information at 2.15 about the card and the name.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: All right. Oh yes, what they had not
18 got of course was the address, until they went to the
19 gym.
20 MR MANSFIELD: So it was a card and a name, then they go to
21 the gym.
22 Again I suggest, something else that's gone wrong,
23 you were not told about it, and I appreciate there are
24 other officers.
25 Were you, when you came back at 7.10, told that in
156
1 fact, or alerted to the fact that besides the gym card
2 there was quite a lot of correspondence in the bag that
3 related to the name Osman, and amongst the torn-up
4 correspondence were torn-up photographs?
5 A. I wasn't, sir, no.
6 Q. Mr Macbrayne, who may be dealing with this, you know him
7 quite as well?
8 A. I know Mr Macbrayne, sir.
9 Q. When you came back at 7.10, did you see him at all, do
10 you remember?
11 A. I am sure I did, sir.
12 Q. So on no occasion after you came back did he say, look,
13 actually -- the jury have them in their bundle and I am
14 not going to put them to you because you didn't see
15 them. He didn't even tell you that there were other
16 photographs in the rucksack?
17 A. I didn't know about the photographs.
18 Q. Yes. That's something else that went wrong, because
19 even though it may or may not have helped, you should
20 have been told about that, shouldn't you?
21 A. The fact of the photographs I would like to have known,
22 sir, but I don't think it would have affected the event.
23 Q. That's another point. You should have been told about
24 the existence of other photographs; you agree?
25 A. Yes, sir.
157
1 Q. Right. Next stage. In your absence, who was the
2 Silver, I am going to call them the in-house Silver,
3 I think you may understand that. You were a Silver?
4 A. There is a firearms command system, sir, with Gold,
5 Silvers and Bronzes. If you like, I am referred to
6 Silver in some people's explanations of the structure,
7 but it's sort of Silver investigation.
8 Q. All right, Silver investigation.
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Really what I am after is, because Mr McDowall sets
11 a strategy at 4.55, you know that now?
12 A. I do now, sir.
13 Q. Were you surprised when you got back that nobody had
14 told you about that during the night?
15 A. That was the event, sir, that we talked about with the
16 card I would have stayed, I think it's all continuing,
17 really.
18 Q. Sorry, the short answer is, leave aside the card for
19 a moment, you should have been told about that, you
20 should have been telephoned about the strategy at 4.55,
21 shouldn't you?
22 A. And the address at Scotia, yes.
23 Q. You should have been and that was something else that
24 went wrong. You weren't told?
25 A. I don't agree it went wrong in a way, sir. It is
158
1 frustrating for me I didn't know until later, but it
2 didn't change the events. Other police officers are
3 there dealing with it.
4 Q. I will suggest how it affected events. So that at
5 3 o'clock -- I am taking that time because that's when
6 you said in fact you left the Yard because you had been
7 writing up the firearms authority?
8 A. I have got that on the firearms --
9 Q. Yes, I will accept the time, that's fine. So at
10 3 o'clock; who is the firearms Silver at 4.55 who is
11 going to implement the Gold strategy set by Mr McDowall?
12 A. There was no firearms Silver allocated at that stage.
13 I had allocated when I left Silvers for the morning.
14 Any emergency deployment for anything overnight, I had
15 had a conversation certainly with Mr Mellody, and you
16 have -- and I was aware of his position in the ops room.
17 The ops room is then run by the ops co-ordinator and the
18 deputy ops co-ordinator, and the deputy ops
19 co-ordinator, who I think is Alan, could perform that
20 role and indeed did for the surveillance.
21 Q. Yes, I am leaving surveillance out of it for the moment,
22 because I'm going to suggest something else that went
23 wrong here, and I have already asked Mr McDowall about
24 this --
25 A. Sir.
159
1 Q. -- is that the firearms authority was asking your
2 deputy -- I am talking about the document, you went
3 through it this morning, do you remember?
4 A. Yes, sir.
5 Q. The firearms authority at 11.50 the night before?
6 A. Yes, sir.
7 Q. You wrote out, I think, a paragraph in which
8 Angela Scott had been tasked with the job of identifying
9 Silver and briefing, that's the word in there?
10 A. I did explain briefing as in explaining that they are
11 going to be the Silvers for two different teams in the
12 morning.
13 Q. Did she go round and talk to them all and say: you could
14 be a Silver in the morning?
15 A. I don't know how she did it. I left her to arrange
16 that.
17 Q. She didn't say she did that, you see. She said she
18 wasn't asked to brief, so we will leave that to one --
19 A. By brief I do mean explain they are going to be --
20 because there is nothing to brief at that stage. They
21 are just going to be allocated.
22 Q. You need to alert people that they might be on the job,
23 and of course it's not just the teams at 7; there is the
24 overnight team that will need a Silver?
25 A. Well, they are not deployed, sir, so they don't need
160
1 a team. The teams are going out.
2 Q. We will get to deployment in one second. Do you know
3 now what in fact McDowall said in relation to his
4 strategy at 4.55?
5 A. I couldn't comment on that, sir.
6 Q. I'm not asking you for a comment. Do you know what he
7 said? You have come back at 7.10. Do you know what he
8 has already said at 4.55?
9 A. Not now, sir, no --
10 Q. What he said, I'll go to it quickly, was mobile
11 surveillance, effectively, with armed support, but the
12 way he put it was he wanted the address, controlled by
13 obviously surveillance and challenge and so forth, and
14 he wanted back-up by a firearms team as soon as possible
15 and a reconnaissance?
16 A. Right, sir.
17 Q. Do you know that?
18 A. I do now, sir.
19 Q. Well, that's something else that's wrong because the
20 reason I say it's important: did you realise when you
21 came on at 7.10 that a red team had already got to
22 Scotia Road at 6 o'clock in the morning and were
23 unsupported by a firearms team because the standby team
24 had not been sent?
25 A. I was aware that the red team had deployed shortly after
161
1 6, but there will be that gap, sir, for the firearms
2 team to --
3 Q. The gap in this case, as you agreed during the trial
4 last year, and I'm putting it at its minimum, was from
5 6 o'clock in the morning right the way through to
6 9 o'clock and that's the tightest gap, three hours,
7 surveillance was carried out at Scotia Road with no
8 armed support?
9 You agree?
10 A. My understanding is that's correct, sir.
11 Q. Did you know that at the time?
12 A. At 7.10 when I came in, sir, I realised there was no
13 armed support there because the Silvers were there,
14 I think as I have explained, so the firearms teams
15 should be located with the Silvers and they have just
16 come out of that meeting.
17 Q. Yes, so you must have said to somebody, look here, this
18 is not an acceptable situation and we had better get
19 somebody down there?
20 A. In the 8.15 meeting we talk about, sir, it was making
21 sure the firearms teams were being deployed with the
22 team.
23 Q. Yes, it's all too late, you see, because we have heard
24 that to get the team kitted up, briefed and down there
25 takes two hours, maybe two and a half, from 7 o'clock,
162
1 the time they come on?
2 A. I would expect it to take about an hour and a half from
3 my experience, but at 7.10 when I come on, sir, that
4 process is evolving. I have seen the Silvers, I have
5 checked the photographs and I know that is then
6 happening.
7 Q. Did you ask why the standby team haven't been asked to
8 go down there by anybody tasked by Mr McDowall?
9 A. I didn't, sir, no.
10 Q. Why not?
11 A. There was a hive of activity and my view, sir, is that
12 the early turn teams were going down there with the
13 early turn Silvers to do a long deployment which was
14 what this was going to be, and that was proportionate to
15 what we knew about the addresses.
16 MR MANSFIELD: Sir, it's extremely hot, if I may say so.
17 I was wondering if we could have a short break for fresh
18 air.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: By all means, we will do that. That
20 wouldn't be an inconvenient moment to have it, actually.
21 Ten minutes, ladies and gentlemen.
22 (3.00 pm)
23 (A short break)
24 (3.15 pm)
25 (In the presence of the jury)
163
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
2 MR MANSFIELD: I hope it's a little bit cooler.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I am a bit worried about the lady on
4 the jury who suffers from the cold. Just let me know if
5 it's unbearable. Yes, Mr Mansfield.
6 MR MANSFIELD: I am dealing with a situation where you come
7 back from the break and you are back at New Scotland
8 Yard at 7.10, and I am dealing with specifically, you
9 may not have known of it. Did you know the standby team
10 overnight was called orange?
11 A. Subsequently, sir, not then.
12 Q. I'm not expecting you to know the name of it. The point
13 is I have identified the minimum gap where surveillance
14 wasn't covered by armed support, but I want to deal with
15 that orange team on standby. We now know that in fact
16 a whole structure was in place so that they could
17 deploy, by which I mean go to the location, having been
18 briefed?
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 Q. There is an overnight DSO in fact has been identified.
21 There are plenty of people who could have been the
22 Silvers to go with them and so on?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. So it's all there. The question I have for you if you
25 can help is: who had the responsibility, as a firearms
164
1 Silver at 4.55, to implement McDowall's policy, ie get
2 them down there as soon as possible to support
3 surveillance?
4 A. I don't know who had taken that role, sir.
5 Q. Even in retrospect you can't help us which of the many
6 possible Silver rank officers, and we have heard about
7 Mellody, Macbrayne, who we have already mentioned, and
8 Alan is not really a firearms, but he could probably
9 do --
10 A. He could be a Silver, sir.
11 Q. He could be a Silver. So we have potentials but you
12 don't know which one it was?
13 A. No, sir.
14 Q. Right. But you do appreciate at least this now, that
15 had they been briefed, because they were all kitted up
16 and ready?
17 A. Right, sir.
18 Q. And I don't know whether you knew this, they had
19 actually, one witness will say, been brought to New
20 Scotland Yard?
21 A. I learnt that very recently, sir.
22 Q. So if that's right, and we will await and see whether
23 that is right, if the orange team are kitted up and at
24 New Scotland Yard, what's needed is plainly a briefing?
25 A. Yes, sir.
165
1 Q. Then they have to zoom down to, and it would at that
2 stage be, well, if the order goes out at 5 o'clock in
3 the morning, they could have been, the standby team, at
4 Scotia Road or the vicinity of it rather than obviously
5 the road itself, by 6.30, couldn't they?
6 A. Potentially, sir, but I wasn't there.
7 Q. Potentially, they could. I'm suggesting to you when you
8 look back on it, that's something that went wrong, isn't
9 it?
10 A. I wouldn't agree it went wrong, sir. I can't comment
11 because I wasn't there. There may have been reasons and
12 decisions taken but I wasn't there.
13 Q. You see, there is no document available indicating:
14 well, we won't send them down; what we have is the order
15 to get a team down there. We have no information as to
16 why they weren't sent, do you follow?
17 A. I do, sir.
18 Q. When you come back at 7.10, you plainly discuss, if you
19 didn't know all the details of the strategy overnight,
20 you have to catch up rather quickly as to what the
21 strategy is going to be?
22 A. Yes, sir.
23 Q. Did you know first of all exactly what Cressida Dick,
24 who is in a sense working alongside you, isn't she?
25 A. Yes, sir.
166
1 Q. Although she is taking the decisions, you have to be
2 there to help. Did you know what strategist decision
3 she had noted down?
4 A. In her notebook, sir?
5 Q. Yes.
6 A. No, sir.
7 Q. What did she tell you the strategy was in relation --
8 I am going to concentrate, leave aside the people who
9 are not suspects?
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 Q. We know there is that aspect of it. But in relation to
12 suspects who may or are, all right?
13 A. Yes, sir.
14 Q. What was her strategy over that?
15 A. It was as was put on the wall, sir, I think which
16 I referred to earlier, which was in the decision log
17 entry.
18 Q. Yes, you have already mentioned that. That's the one
19 you think was written up by Mr Johnston on a board?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. I want to go a bit further than that, and so that we
22 don't waste time on it, I am going to ask for the
23 document to be put before you. You don't have it there.
24 It is in fact Cressida Dick's decision log timed at
25 7.30, although she wrote it up much later on the same
167
1 day.
2 Could we have document 1718, please. Have you ever
3 seen this before?
4 A. No, sir.
5 Q. You haven't. I am going to take it slowly because
6 I want to ask you whether you knew that this was what
7 was in her mind. The reason I am going to ask you this
8 is that if you didn't know about this, it's possible
9 that those on the ground didn't know it either. That's
10 why I want to ask. Do you follow?
11 A. I do, sir.
12 Q. So the --
13 MR PERRY: Sir, I am very sorry, to Mr Mansfield, I am very
14 sorry. This document which is currently on the
15 screen --
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I was looking it up in the bundle,
17 actually.
18 MR PERRY: I am very sorry, I hope this is helpful. This
19 document which is currently on the screen is
20 an inaccurate version that was prepared and was not
21 checked by Commander Dick. The correct document is
22 document 419, and the decision is at page 72. It's just
23 that this other document caused some confusion, and
24 I see Mr Hilliard agrees.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Page what?
168
1 MR PERRY: Sir, it's document 419, and it's page 72. The
2 document that was put on the screen was not in fact
3 created by --
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Have a look at that one.
5 MR PERRY: That's the correct document which is now on the
6 screen.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well.
8 MR MANSFIELD: That's decision 10, I am looking for decision
9 3.
10 MR PERRY: Decision 3 is page 65.
11 MR MANSFIELD: Thank you very much. I'll read it off there.
12 I understand there may be some differences. One
13 document was used in the Health and Safety trial and one
14 wasn't.
15 So decision 3. I am not sure whether this one has
16 the time of the decision. Could we go up a bit.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: 8 o'clock.
18 A. 8 am, sir.
19 MR MANSFIELD: 8 am, right. So we have the time, this is
20 a decision she takes at 8 am and you are meeting her
21 during this period, are you not?
22 A. 8.15, sir, we had the meeting, do you remember in the
23 forward intelligence.
24 Q. That's what I mean. Shortly after this, you have the
25 meeting. I am concentrating on suspects. If we can
169
1 read:
2 "Strategy I have agreed with Commander McDowall is
3 that..."
4 It's number 2:
5 "We seek to arrest any of the subjects..."
6 Can I insert "suspects" because that's really what
7 it's meaning, is that right?
8 A. Yes, sir.
9 Q. "... near or at the addresses."
10 Did you know that?
11 A. I have not seen this document before, sir.
12 Q. I appreciate that. Sorry, I am taking it slowly. Did
13 you know on the morning before 9.30 or 9.34 that what
14 had been agreed by Cressida Dick and Commander McDowall
15 who had set the Gold strategy, that the object was to
16 arrest any of the suspects near or at the addresses?
17 A. No, sir.
18 Q. Well, that is rather important, isn't it?
19 A. Well, it's important that Commander Dick informs the
20 Silver Commanders which she did of the strategy, she
21 spoke to them directly, but I didn't know about at the
22 addresses, sir, no.
23 Q. Do you know what she told the Silvers about this?
24 A. No, sir. She spoke to them on the telephone. I heard
25 her talking to them but I did not recall the
170
1 conversation she had with them. She spoke to them after
2 the 8.15 meeting.
3 Q. Right. Did she tell you at the 8.15 meeting that --
4 well, from what you are saying, she didn't. So at the
5 8.15 meeting, 15 minutes after this decision, that was
6 one of the objectives, and if you look in the reasons?
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 Q. I'll read it since you have not seen it before:
9 "The subjects [suspects] are believed to have made
10 serious attempt to detonate explosives on public
11 transport yesterday. I have seen a video on train of
12 one of these. It is believed they are at large and may
13 still have capacity to cause explosions. They are
14 clearly capable of causing mass murder and do not, or
15 did not yesterday, care if they die. The risks they
16 pose to Londoners is very considerable."
17 Then you see this:
18 "We cannot [emphasised in capital letters] therefore
19 allow them to travel far even under surveillance if
20 sighted as I cannot guarantee we will not have
21 a surveillance loss which could be catastrophic."
22 Did you know that that was part of the reasoning for
23 arresting them near or at the address?
24 A. I have not seen that, sir, no.
25 Q. You can't help as to whether that -- you can read the
171
1 rest if you wish, I am not going to the rest. She is
2 talking about risk inside the premises and so on, and
3 one appreciates the Madrid context?
4 A. Yes, sir.
5 Q. The real point I want to put across to you is the core
6 of her strategy agreed with McDowall was arrest near or
7 at the address. I think there may be just another
8 section -- no, there isn't in that version, I'll
9 concentrate on that version.
10 So that's the first point.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It was near rather than at, as has been
12 spelt out in the reasons.
13 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, it's near rather than at.
14 Because you want a safe distance away from the
15 property so that you don't alert the people in it. We
16 have been over that ground.
17 A. Yes, absolutely.
18 Q. Right. Were you aware that in fact by the time she has
19 set that agreed objective, can I call it that, as well
20 as strategy, were you aware nobody had in fact done
21 a reconnaissance of the location?
22 A. I wasn't, sir, no.
23 Q. A reconnaissance is very important, isn't it?
24 A. Well, again, sir, that depends on the context. You
25 mentioned earlier, I think, that Mr McDowall had
172
1 requested one.
2 Q. Yes?
3 A. That would be discussed between Mr McDowall and the
4 tactical adviser, whoever was present, with regards to
5 the ability to do a reconnaissance in the area.
6 Normally, you would do that before, like a containment
7 and call-out, so you would really get to know the detail
8 (inaudible) the doors, windows, that sort of stuff.
9 Q. Absolutely.
10 A. When you know someone is at the address. My
11 understanding, at this stage when I came in the morning,
12 that it was a MASTS deployment, as you have described,
13 so it was to support the surveillance, so you would not
14 therefore be exposing the firearms officers in and
15 around the address doing a reconnaissance. I understand
16 Mr McDowall asked for it.
17 Q. McDowall asked for it and the problem we have here is
18 that Andrew, the senior tactical adviser who you have
19 talked about before, didn't know about this. Did you
20 know about that?
21 A. Sorry, didn't know about this document?
22 Q. Sorry, didn't know about the strategy which involved
23 sending a firearms as soon as possible with
24 a reconnaissance?
25 A. Well, I find that difficult to understand because Andrew
173
1 was the night duty tactical adviser and I understand
2 Mr McDowall was in during the night, so I can't answer
3 that, sir.
4 Q. All right. Just on a question of location for a moment,
5 one isn't expecting the moon, as it were, in order to
6 say to an operations room as soon as you have an address
7 and an area: find out as much as we can about the area;
8 that's not difficult, is it?
9 A. The surveillance team, initially, sir, would --
10 Q. Even before you send anybody down there, if you are
11 an officer in charge of an operation being run from
12 an operations room, never mind a map of the whole area,
13 it's pretty easy, isn't it, for the operations room to
14 say: I need to know where that address is.
15 A. Forgive me, sir, intelligence-wise, yes, that would be
16 done.
17 Q. It's a bit more than that. You just get a map up on the
18 screen, as it were, showing you the road and the type of
19 facilities in the road; that's not difficult, is it?
20 A. It's not difficult, sir, no, I am sure that would have
21 been done.
22 Q. As I understand it, so far, nobody has suggested it was
23 done. Do you remember seeing anybody consulting any
24 kind of map or diagram -- I'll concentrate on
25 Scotia Road -- of Scotia Road showing the blocks and the
174
1 houses?
2 A. We are at odds, sir, again. For the control room to do
3 that, I don't think necessarily that's important. For
4 the firearms teams to do that before they go down there,
5 they might well do that, and the tactical advisers. But
6 with regards to the control room, I don't think it's
7 key.
8 Q. All right. You think it is not key but you think it
9 would be for firearms?
10 A. I think they would normally have a look at where they
11 are going to go.
12 Q. All right, I'll leave that for firearms. That's one
13 aspect of the strategy set at 8 o'clock?
14 A. Yes, sir.
15 Q. In agreement with Mr McDowall. I want to do another
16 aspect of the strategy. What happens either just before
17 8 o'clock or the 8.15 meeting or just after is that the
18 strategy is amended, the overall strategy is amended to
19 deal with Scotia Road; in other words we are only going
20 to tackle, I am going to use that word, suspects, forget
21 about the rest?
22 A. Yes, sir.
23 Q. Right?
24 A. Yes, sir.
25 Q. That is quite important, isn't it?
175
1 A. Well, again, sir, the strategy remained people from 21
2 but we didn't have control of the door. So the strategy
3 was still the same, I think it's possibly language, to
4 stop people coming out of 21 if they were non-suspects,
5 but we didn't have control of the front door and we were
6 working towards it, obviously.
7 Q. I understand that point. Was this amendment noted
8 anywhere?
9 A. I believed at the time it was written down by
10 Commander Dick but I subsequently believe now that it
11 wasn't.
12 Q. In fact it wasn't recorded anywhere, was it?
13 A. That's my understanding, sir, yes.
14 Q. Nor was it amended on the white board in the control
15 room?
16 A. I could understand that, sir. I think the strategy
17 remained the people from 21 and everybody was aware
18 there was a communal door, that I did believe that
19 myself or Commander Dick had made a note of that,
20 I thought it was Commander Dick, but it hadn't been
21 done.
22 Q. Rather as I suggested on the other matter of this
23 strategy, was this change communicated to the
24 surveillance officers on the ground?
25 A. Again, sir, they had already been allowing people to
176
1 leave because of the communal door.
2 Q. They had already been asking what are we to do; did you
3 know that?
4 A. I didn't know that, sir, no.
5 Q. Who is the surveillance inspector who you have
6 mentioned, and if it's a name that can't be mentioned --
7 you said you were sure there was a surveillance
8 inspector, do you remember?
9 A. Yes, sir. For the Special Branch, teams there was
10 a surveillance inspector, who -- I believe I can say --
11 is Mr Whiddett, and then there is also a superintendent,
12 sir, who was Mr Connell, Superintendent Joe Connell.
13 Q. Can I just follow this through. We will hear that
14 a team leader, surveillance team leader was
15 communicating with the control room about concerns about
16 the buses, about the distance that the firearms team
17 were away, so they must be by this stage at
18 Nightingale Lane, so we are talking about 8.45 onwards?
19 A. Right, sir.
20 Q. The distance they were away, and also of course the
21 question of the communal door and do they stop women and
22 children; do you follow, these concerns?
23 A. Right, sir.
24 Q. Did you hear about any of those?
25 A. No, sir, I didn't.
177
1 Q. Did you hear about anybody saying and talking about
2 Mr Whiddett talking about this?
3 A. No, sir, I would expect them to be recorded in the ops
4 room. If those concerns were coming into the ops room,
5 what would normally happen, either the monitor or the
6 inspector or in this case we had a superintendent in
7 there as well. Or even to add to your confusion, there
8 is an ops room manager in there, normally a sergeant,
9 that they would be recorded by one of those people as to
10 the fact: these are the concerns, how are we going to
11 address them.
12 Q. Yes, so there are plenty of people in the ops room who
13 are in a position to record these concerns; is that
14 right, is that fair?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. I just want to move on from that, because what I am
17 wanting to suggest here is quite a lot of important
18 decisions taken at the centre are just not getting
19 through to the people on the ground and what the people
20 on the ground are concerned about is just not getting
21 through to the ops room. Do you follow?
22 A. I understand your point, sir, yes.
23 Q. Can I just go back one stage to the exercise. All of
24 this was anticipated in the exercise on the 15th, wasn't
25 it?
178
1 A. I haven't seen the document recently, sir, and I wasn't
2 part of the exercise. I did read it.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Operation Catto.
4 A. Yes, sir.
5 MR MANSFIELD: As it's been introduced through you, can
6 I ask for it to come back up to deal with the headings
7 at least. It's document 7797.
8 A. I have it, sir.
9 Q. The operations room has already -- that section has
10 been, as it were, read out about confusing picture and
11 so on.
12 I am not going through that section as it's been
13 read. What hasn't been read is the bit below that. On
14 the next page, all of this has in fact been at least
15 submitted by Pat, the very man who was on the
16 surveillance monitor desk.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You mean he wrote this report?
18 MR MANSFIELD: I can't say whether he wrote it, but his name
19 appears under the word "submitted" on the next page,
20 there. There could be more than one Pat but as
21 a codename, I doubt it, so I am assuming that that
22 Pat --
23 MR HORWELL: I assume it is, yes.
24 MR MANSFIELD: -- is the same one that sat on the desk.
25 As I say, I don't know whether he wrote it but he
179
1 certainly put his name to it?
2 A. Yes, sir.
3 Q. Let us assume for the moment he did write it. But in
4 any event, communications, you see this next bit:
5 "Throughout the exercise there were a number of
6 problems with virtually all of the communications
7 systems in place. Some were easily rectified, whilst
8 a reliance on mobile telephones ensured the operation
9 continued. A basic need for new headsets and even more
10 radio terminals, along with audible speakers for crucial
11 decisions just prior to executive action were agreed
12 upon. Due to the distances travelled during the day and
13 despite the previous reassurances, the Cougar system
14 failed to deliver clear relays."
15 Then there is other technical failures?
16 A. Yes, sir.
17 Q. In fact on the day, this day, the operation was
18 beleaguered by all sorts of malcommunication, wasn't it?
19 A. I don't know malcommunication. I can see those comments
20 there and we updated with the Airwave radio. This was
21 on 15 July, I believe, sir.
22 Q. Yes, it was?
23 A. The events occurred on the 21st. I don't know when this
24 document was created in actual fact, either. Would you
25 be able to help me with that?
180
1 Q. I can't help you because we only got it this morning.
2 A. I am aware the document may have been created after the
3 events of the 22nd. I am not sure about that, though,
4 sir.
5 Q. There was due to be -- I'll just shoot on, I don't know
6 whether it helps -- at the end of this, just above the
7 word "Pat", next page, sorry, just for a moment. It
8 says there was going to be a fuller debrief on Tuesday,
9 Wednesday, 19th/20th do you see that?
10 A. Yes, sir.
11 Q. I don't know whether that helps?
12 A. I don't know who got this document and when to actually
13 act upon it. I think the best person to speak to, who
14 I had asked to, because this was something I actually
15 put in track, if that makes sense, sir, the operation to
16 exercise things, is Superintendent Connell, who was in
17 the ops room that morning.
18 Q. Yes. If we can go back to an earlier page quickly,
19 7770, we see the list of people who at least were
20 intending to be there, whether they turned up I don't
21 know, but the attendees will include, and there is
22 Allison, who's DSO potential?
23 A. That's correct, sir, yeah.
24 Q. He was on duty on the 21st, McDowall we have heard
25 about, he was on duty, and Connell there,
181
1 Detective Superintendent, was there?
2 A. Yes, sir.
3 Q. I can certainly defer any further questions in detail to
4 others, but if we just go to 7798 for the final heading,
5 on what was going wrong even during the exercise, you
6 see it's headed, top of the page, "Structure":
7 "It quickly became apparent that the command
8 structure was not equipped to deal with the
9 ever-changing picture and that the decision-making
10 process in respect of responsibility was confused. This
11 was resolved and a clearer configuration evolved which
12 seemed to reduce the levels of command. It seemed that
13 a sole SIO [senior investigating officer] in possession
14 of all the available intelligence and his tactical
15 advisers from SO19 [and then military] on either side
16 based in the main operations room would be the best way
17 of making fast-time decisions."
18 A. Or so it was suggested.
19 Q. Yes.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: This is not in the jury bundle, I don't
21 know whether anybody wants it.
22 MR MANSFIELD: No I appreciate, we have only got it
23 ourselves today.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I am not suggesting necessarily that it
25 should be.
182
1 MR MANSFIELD: Not for the moment. I think it's perhaps
2 more appropriate when there is somebody like Mr Connell
3 or possibly Mr Mellody. I don't know who will be in
4 a position to deal with these identified problems.
5 Now, finally, this: I want to ask you about another
6 document which I believe, well, I don't know, I am going
7 to ask you if you ever saw it. That is a very important
8 document was provided to you at about the time of the
9 firearms authority. I don't know whether you remember
10 that or not?
11 A. Which document, sir, sorry?
12 Q. It's a tactical options document.
13 A. By Andrew, sir?
14 Q. That's right. Well, it was by two officers, and we have
15 seen, and the jury have, I think, a particular page of
16 this, and if we could have section 10 just to give you
17 some idea of it, section 10, which is behind tab 42.
18 A lot of it has been redacted, but this is just to, one
19 part of it?
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. Do you remember receiving this?
22 A. I do, sir, yes, late on the evening, I think, of the
23 21st.
24 Q. Yes. Did you take any notice of it?
25 A. Well, I was doing a lot of things, sir, I certainly
183
1 looked at it. It was a document that had been provided
2 by, I think, Andrew and Esposito.
3 Q. If I can put it generally, it's 34 pages long. This is
4 just one bit of it?
5 A. Yes, sir.
6 Q. They had gone to a lot of trouble, had they not, to lay
7 out in generic, general terms what was available and
8 what tactics were available, hadn't they?
9 A. Yeah, I think it wasn't a definitive document but it
10 tried to encompass a number of firearms tactics, sir.
11 Q. Yes, firearms tactics and also resources, bearing in
12 mind training, Kratos, Clydesdale, it was embracing
13 everything and saying to the senior officers: look, this
14 is from two tactical officers, Esposito and Andrew, this
15 is our combined information, wisdom and so on, of the
16 moment; if you need to act during the night, you now
17 know what's possible.
18 A. They did produce the document, sir, but more important
19 for me, we had Esposito in the day and we had Andrew at
20 night, so we had the officers who -- I think it was
21 a joint document between the two.
22 Q. Yes. What I want to suggest to you, like some of the
23 other aspects of this, you really didn't bother with it
24 very much, did you?
25 A. Well, I looked at the document, they discussed the
184
1 document with me, the number of pages, sir, and what
2 I was doing, I didn't go into it in any great detail
3 that evening, but importantly the two officers who
4 authored it were advising us.
5 Q. You see, the reason I ask you is you make no reference
6 to this document in any of your red book notes, decision
7 logs or anything else, do you?
8 A. I don't know, sir.
9 Q. Would you take it from me, you don't make any reference
10 to being given this generic tactical options document?
11 A. I accept that, sir.
12 Q. You make no reference to the fact that you looked at it
13 or gained any information from it or whatever. Was it
14 a situation it just came in, is this fair, comes in: oh
15 yes, they are here, I don't need to read this. Was that
16 the situation?
17 A. Not quite, it's a reference document, sir, but the
18 people who wrote it are advising me, and this will not
19 answer many of the questions that people with the skills
20 and the knowledge will, who were with me in the ops
21 room.
22 Q. Dealing with that specific, those people who are with
23 you, when it comes to the actual possibility of
24 deployment, what you need is a tailored tactical options
25 for what you are then facing?
185
1 A. Potentially, sir, yes.
2 Q. What should happen is the senior tactical adviser on
3 overnight, if he knows, should then draft a series of
4 tailored options, for Scotia Road, this is what we can
5 do; and then the officer who is implementing the 4.55
6 policy at 5 o'clock looks through the specified tailored
7 options and ticks or crosses them off. That's what
8 should happen?
9 A. No, I don't agree with that, Mr Mansfield. I have not
10 seen a document like this before. I think it had been
11 sensibly prepared by Andrew and Mr Esposito. They are
12 there to provide, and they are outstanding senior
13 tactical advisers, to provide the advice that is
14 required in the circumstances of whatever challenges we
15 have. You don't then look at this document to tick them
16 off.
17 Q. No, not this document?
18 A. Forgive me, sir.
19 Q. I have moved one stage on. This is generic. This gives
20 those on duty overnight some overview and you have not
21 seen one of these before. However, when it gets close
22 to the action, ie strategy, 4.55, surveillance and armed
23 support, down to Scotia Road or Portnall, as came on
24 stream?
25 A. Sir.
186
1 Q. Right? At that point, what I suggest would normally
2 happen in a firearms operation, if the tactical adviser
3 knows about it, is they give oral advice as to what
4 tactics are open and they give written advice?
5 A. They certainly give oral advice. In the dynamic
6 situations, written advice can follow much later, sir.
7 Q. In which obviously the senior officer is then in
8 a position to decide which he is going to adopt and
9 which he is going to reject?
10 A. Yes, sir. Often that's just on that verbal explanation.
11 Q. Then it's noted up later. Did you know that that didn't
12 happen on this occasion during the night?
13 A. I wasn't there, sir.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you. Yes, Mr Gibbs.
15 Questions from MR GIBBS
16 MR GIBBS: Sir, may I ask some questions about surveillance?
17 I represent the red and grey surveillance teams.
18 A. Sir.
19 Q. Can I keep it very simple. We know that when the man
20 came out of Scotia Road, he was described at one time as
21 being worth a second look?
22 A. Yes, sir.
23 Q. We know that he was later described as being a possible
24 or a good possible for Nettle Tip, which was the
25 codename given to Hussain Osman; yes?
187
1 A. Yes, sir.
2 Q. Did you hear both of those things: that is the "worth
3 a second look" and the "possible" or the "good possible"
4 in the control room?
5 A. No, sir. As I think I have explained, the person
6 listening is purely Pat to the surveillance channel.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: He is using headphones.
8 A. He is using headphones, sir, yes.
9 MR GIBBS: So you realised at some point that there was
10 a man who had come out at a particular time who was
11 being described as a possible?
12 A. Yes, sir.
13 Q. Then you later got the impression that this man was
14 definitely not Nettle Tip?
15 A. That's correct, sir, yes.
16 Q. You got that impression from something which Mr Esposito
17 said?
18 A. That's correct, yes.
19 Q. Was he in contact with anyone on the ground?
20 A. Yes, sir, he was.
21 Q. Who was that?
22 A. His tactical adviser on the ground, sir --
23 Q. Is that someone we are calling Trojan 84?
24 A. I believe it will be, sir, but he would have to give
25 that, he would have to confirm that.
188
1 Q. That person was the tactical adviser to Mr Purser?
2 A. That would be correct, sir, yes.
3 Q. Would they have been in the same car?
4 A. They would, sir, yes.
5 Q. Then later you realised, did you, that the surveillance
6 team were still following the man?
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 Q. And that they were still working on the basis that he
9 was a possible or something like that?
10 A. No, sir, that's not my understanding. It was that he
11 had come out of the address and it was possibly
12 Mr Osman, and then through Mr Esposito I was told it
13 wasn't. So through Pat, obviously it's three years ago,
14 but Pat must have been in agreement, otherwise he would
15 have said no, they are still saying it's him. You can't
16 use the non-armed officers.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: How could Pat have a view on it? He
18 was merely the conduit, wasn't he?
19 A. No, sir, but Pat -- we are all in a very close area --
20 Pat became aware that Dingemans was going and Dingemans
21 should have been in contact and I know was with the
22 surveillance team leader to go and try and stop the
23 person when he got off the bus.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Sorry, it may be my fault. I thought
25 you said, and I'm reading the script:
189
1 "It was that he had come out of the address and it
2 was possibly Mr Osman, and then through Mr Esposito I
3 was told it wasn't. So through Pat... Pat must have
4 been in agreement..."
5 How could Pat have been in agreement? He didn't
6 have the faintest idea.
7 A. If I could explain, sir, Pat is there, so if, for any
8 reason, the subject is then still believed to be
9 Mr Osman.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Pat wouldn't have a view about it one
11 way or the other, would he?
12 A. He is listening to the surveillance channel.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: No, but all he is doing is he is
14 repeating what he is being told.
15 A. Yes, but I am probably making this very badly, but the
16 point is that I am sure Pat would have made me aware if,
17 and others in the room, we had actually been told some
18 wrong information by Mr Esposito.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: How would Pat know?
20 A. We are all there, sir. You can hear what's happening
21 quite clearly.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: All right.
23 MR GIBBS: It may be that the best thing would be for us
24 simply to ask Pat.
25 A. I think so, sir, yes.
190
1 Q. And he will know, won't he?
2 A. Yes, sir, I agree.
3 Q. As you described it, unless I have got it wrong, he has
4 his headphones on and he is not listening to what
5 Mr Esposito is saying?
6 A. No, sir, but I am standing right in the middle, I think
7 I have shown you where I am, and it was my belief that
8 Pat was aware.
9 Q. I see. You had the advantage of knowing both what Pat
10 was saying and what Mr Esposito was saying?
11 A. I would agree with that, sir, yes.
12 Q. Then at some later time you ask for a percentage
13 identification. You ask Pat to pass that message on?
14 A. I did, sir, yes.
15 Q. You asked more than once?
16 A. A couple of times, I think, sir, maybe even three.
17 Q. But you were never given a percentage?
18 A. No, and I understand that's very difficult.
19 Q. Then you believed from what Pat said to you that this
20 was Osman?
21 A. Yes, sir.
22 Q. Did he say words to the effect of "they think it's him"?
23 A. My recollection is, sir, and it is three years ago, Pat
24 said, "They are saying it's him", but I think I have
25 already explained, I was somewhat cautious because of
191
1 the first morning of an operation and how difficult that
2 would be.
3 Q. Could you just explain in surveillance terms what the
4 significance of it being the first morning is?
5 A. Well, people have got to orientate their way around the
6 actual location, very challenging in that area anyway
7 for the surveillance team because of compromise. It's
8 an area where police officers are often identified in
9 plain clothes, both armed response vehicles and
10 surveillance teams, so it's particularly difficult in
11 that area to remain covert for a long period of time.
12 Additionally for the surveillance team, it's the
13 first morning of an operation, it's not something they
14 have been doing for many days so they become familiar
15 with the people involved who they are following. That
16 first identification is really challenging, and I think
17 that sums it up, sir, really, very difficult.
18 Q. You took all that into account?
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 Q. But your impression was, if I have understood your
21 evidence right, from what Pat said, and I think you told
22 the learned Coroner this before lunch, that you were
23 getting the impression that this was a good likeness?
24 A. There are three terms we now use, "positive", "possible"
25 and "negative", and I would have summed it now as
192
1 a possible. That was my personal view.
2 Q. Can I ask you what your understanding of the plan was?
3 Was the plan that, if someone came out and was
4 definitely not one of the subjects, then he or she might
5 be stopped and spoken to by Mr Dingemans' team?
6 A. Subject to Commander Dick's instructions, sir.
7 Q. Of course. And that if somebody came out and he was
8 definitely one of the subjects, if he was definitely one
9 of the suicide bombers, then he would be stopped by the
10 serious(sic) firearms officer team?
11 A. Can I just say, a likeness or above, at that stage to
12 say definitely, I think is extremely ambitious.
13 Q. Thank you. That in fact was my third question. If
14 someone came out who was a possible or a likeness for
15 a man who the day before had tried to murder a lot of
16 people on the Underground system, would he have been
17 stopped by an SFO team?
18 A. Yes, sir, he would.
19 Q. In terms of information which is coming into the control
20 room, am I right in thinking that there is an important
21 distinction to be drawn between the raw information from
22 those who are on the ground, and conclusions which may
23 be drawn from that information?
24 A. I think I follow, sir, yes.
25 Q. So that a surveillance officer on the ground may
193
1 describe what a person is wearing or what he looks like,
2 or what he is doing, and the control room may draw
3 conclusions from that description?
4 A. That's possible, sir.
5 Q. In drawing conclusions, the control room will have
6 access to other sources of information?
7 A. Yes, sir.
8 Q. It may be from more than one surveillance team?
9 A. Yes, indeed, sir.
10 Q. It may be from technical support in the forward
11 intelligence cell in the next door room?
12 A. Yes, sir.
13 Q. It may be from other officers or intelligence which has
14 already been received?
15 A. From various sources, sir.
16 Q. So there is a distinction to be drawn between those who
17 provide raw information and those who draw conclusions
18 from it?
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 MR GIBBS: Thank you very much.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you, Mr Gibbs. Mr Stern.
22 Questions from MR STERN
23 MR STERN: Mr Boutcher, I think you had an opportunity of
24 seeing the London Underground CCTV clips of the
25 terrorists of 21 July?
194
1 A. I have seen those, sir, yes.
2 Q. They were caught on CCTV on their way to wreak the
3 devastation and death to those on the Underground?
4 A. Yes, sir.
5 Q. Looking at those clips, were there any clues in their
6 behaviour in those individuals that they were to act in
7 the way that they intended?
8 A. None whatsoever, sir, in fact the opposite.
9 Q. What do you mean, the opposite?
10 A. They all seemed very relaxed. The only information I
11 had ever previously read about suicide operatives was
12 signals like sweating a lot, nervous, but those four men
13 seemed very relaxed as they walked to conduct those
14 atrocities.
15 Q. Was there any way of distinguishing those four
16 individuals from the normal members of the public who
17 were using the London Transport system perfectly
18 legitimately that day?
19 A. Absolutely none whatsoever, sir, no.
20 MR STERN: Thank you.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you. Ms Leek.
22 MS LEEK: Sir, before I ask questions, I wonder if my
23 learned friend, Mr Mansfield, might identify those
24 operatives whom he says refused to take the ammunition
25 with them on the day, because he put to this officer
195
1 that some of the officers refused to take that
2 ammunition, and so far as I am aware, none of the
3 officers did in fact refuse.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Can you help?
5 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, we are doing a trawl. I have been asked
6 to do that. I distinctly remember one officer, Delta 4
7 we've come up with at the moment, but I will --
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You have heard the request. No doubt
9 it can be dealt with in due course. Yes, Ms Leek.
10 Questions from MS LEEK
11 MS LEEK: Thank you, sir.
12 Mr Boutcher, I ask questions on behalf of CO19
13 officers who are separately represented, including
14 Andrew, Inspector ZAJ and Trojan 84, and the remaining
15 CO19 officers on the ground who are not represented by
16 Mr Stern.
17 I just have a few questions for you. As
18 I understand it, you don't have an independent log of
19 timings or a contemporaneous log of timings of matters
20 that were happening between 9.30 and 10 o'clock?
21 A. No, I don't.
22 Q. Neither were you on the phone to any of the officers on
23 the ground, Silver and Trojan 84?
24 A. That's correct.
25 Q. So you are unable to say exactly where they were when
196
1 orders were given to get behind the bus and when orders
2 were given to stop Mr de Menezes getting on the tube?
3 A. That's correct, yes.
4 Q. That evidence will have to come from other people?
5 A. Indeed, yes.
6 Q. Because certain timings have been put to you, and I want
7 to get it absolutely straight: those aren't your
8 recollections of timings; we have to listen to what
9 other people say about that?
10 A. Yes, that's correct.
11 Q. As far as briefings are concerned, you have said that
12 you didn't think that the various suspects would be
13 likely to be at the addresses that had been ascertained?
14 A. It was my view that it was unlikely that they would be
15 at obvious addresses.
16 Q. You would accept, however, that it's extremely important
17 that officers on the ground are told that these
18 individuals may well be at the addresses?
19 A. I absolutely agree. There are three levels in my
20 thinking: firstly that they would have gone to
21 an address that we would find challenging to identify;
22 secondly, to reorganise and attack us; secondly(sic),
23 that they may simply have fled out of panic because
24 their aims had not been achieved; or thirdly, indeed
25 they could, there was a possibility that they could have
197
1 been back to, if you like, known address, footprint
2 addresses, to wait for some sort of police activity and
3 to do an atrocity there.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's the Madrid scenario, isn't it,
5 or something very like it?
6 A. Not quite, sir. Madrid they were found through
7 enquiries and compromised, and then they actually seemed
8 to change their intentions. The indications of Madrid
9 were that they were going to conduct further attacks
10 because of the materials that were found there, but then
11 decided to conduct that suicide bombing as the police
12 entered.
13 MS LEEK: So what we are saying is that it is in fact
14 extremely important that officers on the ground,
15 particularly in a novel situation as this was, are fully
16 prepared for what they might have to confront.
17 A. That's absolutely correct, and have a very full briefing
18 with regards to everything that's known.
19 Q. It's also important for them to be told that they have
20 to trust the information that's come in from the control
21 room, from the command team?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Because they will not be in possession of the totality
24 of the information?
25 A. No, I mean, they listen to the surveillance channels
198
1 obviously but yes, that's fair.
2 Q. That's particularly important of course for the firearms
3 officers, that they are told: you have to trust what's
4 coming from on high.
5 A. Yes, we tell them everything that they need to know,
6 certainly.
7 Q. As far as identification is concerned, various questions
8 have been asked about identifying Osman, identifying the
9 man. In fact he was being referred to by a codename
10 over these surveillance channels; is that right?
11 A. Yeah, the codename was Nettle Tip.
12 Q. And the codename for one of the other suspects was Omar?
13 A. No, that's the name, ma'am.
14 Q. Sorry, it was Regal Wave. Of course the other suspect,
15 Omar, the codename was Regal Wave?
16 A. That's correct.
17 Q. So individual officers then had to translate what they
18 were hearing into which suspect it was?
19 A. Yes, that's correct.
20 Q. You were also asked about the number of vehicles that
21 were available in the vicinity. Did you know at any
22 stage how many vehicles were around?
23 A. I had had a discussion with Andrew and effectively there
24 are six SFO teams that -- or that had been made into
25 four.
199
1 Q. I want to stop you when you talk about six SFO teams.
2 Are you talking about teams or are you talking about
3 vehicles?
4 A. I am talking about teams, the coloured teams, and they
5 had enhanced those teams into four teams with annual
6 leave and because of the threats we faced, Andrew and
7 I believe Mr Esposito had presented four teams able to
8 deal with the challenges that obviously we faced.
9 Q. But as far as vehicles were concerned, were you aware of
10 the number of vehicles that deployed to the vicinity of
11 Scotia Road? If not, say so.
12 A. My understanding, there would be around four, five
13 vehicles in that team.
14 Q. We will hear from somebody who did know exactly how
15 many. You were not, as I understand it, privy to
16 conversations between Trojan 80 and Trojan 84 as to the
17 precise location of where the vehicles were?
18 A. No, and I didn't need to be.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Can I just interrupt you a moment,
20 Ms Leek, there is a couple of questions: one I think we
21 have been told the answer to but I'll confirm it.
22 Once the surveillance or the firearms teams for that
23 matter had gone down the escalator, they were out of
24 communication?
25 A. Yes, sir.
200
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: There was no radio or mobile telephone
2 link that could be established?
3 A. Nothing worked at the time, sir, we have addressed that
4 now but nothing at the time.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's what I thought.
6 The other one is, and this I would be interested to
7 know the answer to, why did the suspects Osman and Omar,
8 why did they have codenames?
9 A. It's an inherited system with regards to the
10 counter-terrorism operations to try to make sure we
11 don't reveal the identity of the people we are looking
12 at because of lossage of documents so we try and avoid
13 names on things so it really comes --
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Also presumably so the public shouldn't
15 hear what their names are.
16 A. No, of course, any attempt to sort of get into our
17 communications systems, all that sort of thing.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes. It's a question of
19 confidentiality.
20 A. Security, sir, really.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Security in the first initial stages
22 and if there is subsequently an arrest and trial, if
23 their real names had been bandied about in the press,
24 that might have compromised that as well.
25 A. And associates, because sometimes we have operations
201
1 where we will split things off so it is easier to have
2 code names.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: And associates might know then who is
4 being pursued. Very well. Yes.
5 MS LEEK: Just picking up from that, Officer, is it because
6 despite the fact that some of the channels are
7 encrypted, the capability of terrorists to hack into
8 encrypted systems is not entirely known.
9 A. No, that's fair.
10 MS LEEK: Thank you.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you. Now, Mr Perry, how much are
12 you going to need?
13 MR PERRY: Sir, I think I can finish in about ten minutes,
14 I hope, ten or 15 minutes. I have actually got, famous
15 last words, only nine points, but I hope it doesn't
16 expand.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: How much do you have, Mr Horwell?
18 MR HORWELL: This is the principal interest, principal
19 witness whose interests I represent.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Don't misunderstand me.
21 MR HORWELL: I know. I would anticipate certainly an hour,
22 and possibly at most an hour and a half.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I don't know how you are going to do it
24 other than by telepathy at the moment, but I ask that
25 you and Mr Perry, because your interests are extremely
202
1 close, try not to overlap each other.
2 MR HORWELL: There is no doubt that that will not happen,
3 and if Mr Perry cross-examines tonight and I start
4 tomorrow morning, it will not happen.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Right. Is that a threat or a promise!
6 MR HORWELL: Both.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Mr Perry, nine points.
8 MR PERRY: Thank you very much, sir. Apologies to
9 Mr Horwell if I trespass on his points, but I know he
10 will do them very well, much better than I.
11 Questions from MR PERRY
12 MR PERRY: Mr Boutcher, I am David Perry and I represent
13 Commander McDowall, Cressida Dick, Chief Inspector
14 Esposito and Detective Chief Inspector Purser. I have
15 nine points, as you probably know. I hope I can count
16 properly.
17 Let us start, anyway. The first thing I want to
18 just explore with you very, very briefly, Mr Boutcher,
19 is the question of stopping or diverting public
20 transport and in particular in this case the buses in
21 the Tulse Hill area. May I please just ask you to have,
22 and for us all to have on the screen, page 94 of the
23 documents which we don't have in hard copy. We will
24 have it in due course, but it's something that I showed
25 to Detective Chief Inspector Angela Scott yesterday.
203
1 It's from Cressida Dick's decision log and it's decision
2 32.
3 I just want to ask you about this. There are going
4 to be two points but before I come on to them, just see
5 the decision. It's out of order because Cressida Dick,
6 as we can see from the bottom of this document, says the
7 decision is made at 11.10 am on the 22nd but it's
8 written at 8 pm on the 23rd.
9 In the reasoning it says:
10 "This is something I considered earlier on. It was
11 suggested as an option by DCI Angie Scott. The issue
12 was raised as the premises at Scotia Road were
13 identified early on to be 'near' a bus stop. I have
14 been unable to ascertain how far away. But clearly it
15 is likely that a person coming out of the premises might
16 walk directly to the bus stop making it more difficult
17 for surveillance and, in particular intervention at
18 an early stage. But to stop the buses and divert them
19 will draw attention to the area and potentially alert
20 suspects. I decided then and again after the police
21 shooting at Stockwell where the man came from premises
22 and got on bus that will not do so because of risk. To
23 be kept under review."
24 The two things I want to ask you are these: first of
25 all, can you recall the discussion about this sometime
204
1 around about 8.30?
2 A. I don't recall it now, sir, I am afraid.
3 Q. You don't recall it. Thank you very much for that,
4 Mr Boutcher. I just want to ask you this, and this is
5 the second point. By the way, this is still in my first
6 point of the nine points. I do not want to lose my
7 points.
8 The second aspect of this is this: you of course
9 remained in the operations room throughout until
10 1 August?
11 A. That's correct.
12 Q. When as you told us this morning the operation was
13 successfully concluded with the arrest not only of the
14 four suspects but also of those who had been responsible
15 for aiding and abetting them in their activities?
16 A. Yes, sir.
17 Q. We see from this decision it's to be kept under review.
18 Was there ever at any stage a decision to stop or divert
19 buses either at the Scotia Road address or at the
20 Portnall Road address or any other address?
21 A. No. I agree with the decision. I don't recall being
22 part of it because it would have potentially led to
23 compromise. Our activity was already being tracked by
24 the media. If we start stopping bus stops and bus
25 routes everywhere we were operating, it would be soon
205
1 quite clear to everybody where we were. So we never did
2 that.
3 Q. Would you agree with this, Mr Boutcher: that this type
4 of decision, this type of tactical decision is
5 a difficult decision requiring the exercise of judgment
6 on the part of the senior officer?
7 A. Without doubt, sir, bearing in mind the history of the
8 7th and the 21st and the nature of the attacks. But
9 it's the proportionate and right decision, I think is
10 not to stop the bus stops.
11 Q. Thank you. The second point I want to go on to, and
12 I hope I can deal with this very briefly so we don't
13 have to look at any documents. You were asked about the
14 briefing of firearms officers. May I just put the
15 question I am going to ask you in context. You were
16 asked the question as to whether specialist firearms
17 officers have to be in the mindset that they might be or
18 might not be required to confront a suicide bomber?
19 A. Yes, sir.
20 Q. I am just going to ask these questions in relation to
21 briefings. Would it in your opinion be important that
22 any risks that a firearms officer, whether specialist or
23 otherwise, is going to confront are explained honestly
24 and openly?
25 A. Absolutely, sir, yes.
206
1 Q. Presumably the reason for that -- well, let me ask you.
2 What is the reason for explaining honestly and openly
3 the risks that they might be expected to confront?
4 A. They are the officers who have the ultimate
5 responsibility in dealing with these high risk arrests.
6 They need to be aware of all the facts, whatever history
7 has occurred, whatever learning may have occurred, so
8 that they can have a clear understanding of what type of
9 operation and deployment they are going to be involved
10 in. And care and time has to be taken to do that. You
11 would not want to put the firearms team out unless it
12 was an emergency, and we knew that we had, for instance,
13 one of the suicide bombers in an address now, without
14 proper structured and careful briefing.
15 Q. Again, what goes into the briefing, that's a question of
16 balance on the part of the briefing officer, trying to
17 get the right balance?
18 A. It is, sir, yes.
19 Q. Because what you don't want to do is to say, "Well, you
20 are definitely not going to confront a suicide bomber",
21 because that might affect them, or that "You are
22 definitely going to confront", because that might affect
23 them, but to get the balance right between the two?
24 A. You have to have an even tone and give them the facts,
25 with an even tone.
207
1 Q. Thank you. The third point, this is just a very short
2 question, I hope. You have told us that you have been
3 involved in many, many operations?
4 A. Sir.
5 Q. I think you have described them as, what I think you
6 have said, crime in action situations?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. That's the sort of thing where someone is kidnapped,
9 lives are at stake, operations are run from New Scotland
10 Yard to try to release kidnap victims; not only in this
11 country but, as I understand it, the operations run from
12 New Scotland Yard operate in all countries across the
13 world where Scotland Yard is called in to assist police
14 forces around the world?
15 A. Yeah, both with regard to the Metropolitan Police and
16 the National Crime Squad, sir.
17 Q. You are running an operation in effect from London?
18 A. Yes, sir.
19 Q. Telling people in other countries what to do in order to
20 save lives?
21 A. And in many countries sometimes, sir. In the
22 counter-terrorism aspect that we do now, they are
23 co-ordinated with a number of different countries who we
24 have found to be our -- very much to be our new partners
25 and friends in recent years.
208
1 Q. Using all your background experience, how difficult
2 would you assess for this operation on 21 and
3 22 July 2005 to be?
4 A. It was immensely difficult because we had not faced it
5 before, even though the Metropolitan Police had planned
6 for suicide operations, with Kratos People and Vehicle
7 and Clydesdale, this had not been anticipated that we
8 would be looking for failed suicide attackers. What
9 I think we managed to achieve was have the best possible
10 people to deal with it there at the time, and in effect
11 the model that we adopted that did successfully arrest
12 those people responsible is what now serves as, if you
13 like, the standing operating procedure, the model; with
14 some amendments and finessing, but principally it's the
15 model that we now adopt to deal with that sort of
16 operation.
17 Q. Thank you. The fourth point: you were asked about Pat,
18 and you were told something about what Pat may or may
19 not say. We have yet to hear from Pat.
20 A. Yes, sir.
21 Q. You were told about what Pat may or may not say, to do
22 with shouting across the room?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. The operations room. You said absolutely not?
25 A. Unequivocally not, sir.
209
1 Q. May I just ask you this -- we heard yesterday from
2 Angie Scott, so I can tell you what she actually said.
3 A. Yes, sir.
4 Q. She said that she was standing just a few feet away from
5 Pat. How many feet away from Pat were you?
6 A. I was actually between Pat and Cressida Dick, moving
7 between the two, so when I needed to speak to Pat
8 I would simply step towards him, but even without that
9 I could hear him very clearly.
10 Q. Just tell us, Mr Boutcher, because the explanation you
11 have given us is very vivid, but just tell us in
12 distance terms?
13 A. Two or three feet, sir.
14 Q. Was Angie Scott closer to Pat than you were?
15 A. I can't recall now, sir.
16 Q. How far was Cressida Dick from you? Give us it in feet.
17 A. Again two or three feet the other way, sir.
18 Q. The fifth point I want to ask you about is the gym card,
19 because it was put to you that if you had known that the
20 gym card with an address had been found, would you have
21 stayed? Would you have stayed at New Scotland Yard?
22 A. Sir.
23 Q. Yes. Well, we have to be very careful about this.
24 A gym card with an address wasn't found, you see.
25 A. Right, sir.
210
1 Q. A gym card was found that had no address on it, and that
2 was at 2.15. Now, how long had you been on duty by
3 2.15?
4 A. I was probably on -- I'm normally on at 7 am each
5 morning, so probably, almost certainly from 7 am the
6 morning before.
7 Q. So we are getting on for 20 hours?
8 A. Yes, sir.
9 Q. If you had been told that a gym card had been found but
10 in fact it was being researched as quickly as possible
11 and efforts were being made to contact the owners of the
12 gym club to find out the details of the individual whose
13 name appeared on the gym card, if you had known all that
14 was going on, would you have stayed or would you have
15 taken your rest?
16 A. If I had known all that, sir, it was all in hand,
17 I would have gone.
18 Q. The sixth point -- we are getting there -- the standby
19 team, the orange specialist firearms team, you were
20 asked questions about that. It was put to you, as
21 though it was something that could easily be done, "let
22 us get this orange team down to Scotia Road".
23 Let me just ask you this: if the orange team had
24 gone down to Scotia Road, who would have been covering
25 Portnall Road?
211
1 A. There would have been no team covering Portnall Road.
2 Q. Who would have been covering Corfe House?
3 A. Again, no team, sir.
4 Q. Who would have been covering Blair House?
5 A. No team, sir.
6 Q. Who would have been covering the rest of London?
7 A. They were the only available team, sir; that was it.
8 Nobody.
9 Q. So far as you were concerned, would it have been
10 a sensible decision to send the orange team to
11 Scotia Road on the basis of the intelligence that you
12 then had, with the possibility of further intelligence
13 developments through the morning?
14 A. I think I've previously made my view very clear, sir,
15 that conscious of Mr McDowall's strategy, I think
16 I would have done effectively what happened: the Silvers
17 coming on at 7 o'clock, the tactical advisers coming on
18 at 7 o'clock, so that you have got two teams that can
19 exist for a significant amount of time, because the
20 deployments are going to go on for many days and I am
21 aware of that very likelihood. So that's the position
22 I would have taken.
23 Q. Yes, and one thing you were not reminded of, but I will
24 remind you of it now, is that Mr McDowall had said that
25 his strategy was to be flexible and adaptable depending
212
1 upon intelligence as it was updated.
2 Do you consider that what was done on the morning of
3 22 July was consistent with Mr McDowall's strategy?
4 A. I do, sir. Everybody has clearly been working to ensure
5 that the coverage was put at the addresses. There seems
6 some gap in information, I'm quite confident I'd have
7 spoken to Mr McDowall, informed him those firearms teams
8 are going to go down from 7 o'clock, and that would have
9 been a proportionate response to the information we had.
10 Q. The seventh point, you have been asked about
11 Operation Catto. May we just have page 7797 up on the
12 screen, please? It's just one thing I wanted to ask you
13 about. Do you see under "Communications"?
14 A. Yes, sir.
15 Q. It's only this, so that we have an understanding, it's
16 the final sentence of that paragraph:
17 "An opinion that Airwave would be the answer to this
18 problem was muted ..."
19 This is a reference to Airwave, and it says:
20 "It remains both an untested system in this arena
21 and some way off in the mid-term (18 months)."
22 Could you just explain to us, please, what Airwave
23 radio is?
24 A. Airwave radio is a new national system, so in effect we
25 can communicate. Under the old Cougar system we had to
213
1 have local encryption; with this system we can hear
2 communications from teams in Birmingham, Manchester,
3 wherever. We are able to use it on the Underground
4 system almost wholly now, it's only a couple of stations
5 we can't. It's far more clear than Cougar system. All
6 the surveillance teams now have it. And they have
7 separate operating channels in which to operate on as
8 well. So it's a far better system than the Cougar
9 system.
10 Q. Did some of the teams working on the 22nd actually have
11 Airwave?
12 A. Not to my knowledge, sir, no. None of them.
13 Q. Thank you very much for that, Mr Boutcher.
14 The eighth point, the tactical options document.
15 I am not going to look at it with you, but you have told
16 us it was written by Chief Inspector Andrew and Chief
17 Inspector Esposito, and you described them as
18 outstanding tactical advisers.
19 My question is this: were there any more experienced
20 tactical advisers than those two gentlemen in the
21 Metropolitan Police?
22 A. No, sir, I have worked with them for a number of years
23 on previous operations and they are quite simply the
24 best that we have.
25 Q. The ninth and final point: you were telling us a few
214
1 minutes ago, in answer to my learned friend Ms Leek,
2 about suspects going back to footprint addresses knowing
3 that the police will go there. I just want to explore
4 that, because it was suggested that that was a Madrid
5 type situation and you said "no"?
6 A. Not quite.
7 Q. I just want to understand what this is, because the
8 Madrid situation, the distinction with the Madrid
9 situation is there the police, through investigation and
10 surveillance, came upon an address?
11 A. That's correct, sir.
12 Q. But the suspects hadn't left any footprint that they
13 would be at that address, it was just dogged police work
14 that led the police to those particular premises?
15 A. Yes, sir, they didn't expect the police to be there, to
16 find those premises.
17 Q. But the point that you are making, if I have understood
18 it correctly -- and tell me if I've got it wrong -- is
19 where terrorists have failed to set off bombs but they
20 have left information as to where they might be found,
21 the risk is that they know that the police will be onto
22 them and that the game might be up, and therefore they
23 might be planning an atrocity against police officers
24 because they know that the police are likely to --
25 A. At some point arrive.
215
1 Q. -- at some point or other turn up at these addresses,
2 the footprint addresses?
3 A. That's exactly the point, sir. This is a whole new
4 challenge for us in policing, that we have never seen
5 before, completely different from the experiences we've
6 had in terrorism before with the Irish threat, and you
7 literally have to try and forecast and continge for
8 everything. But for me there was a chance that these
9 people will have simply gone back somewhere to wait for
10 us.
11 MR PERRY: Thank you very much, indeed.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I am not sure that I follow that
13 because it seemed to me that there were two different
14 things. Your initial reaction which you told Mr Perry
15 about and also Mr -- I am not sure. Your original view
16 was that it was unlikely that any of the four would have
17 gone back to any of the footprint addresses, simply for
18 the ordinary banal reason that they would not want to be
19 caught.
20 A. Yes, sir. There is three levels of thinking.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: As you say, the second level, if you
22 like, is: well, that might be wrong, they might have
23 gone back to the footprint addresses deliberately in
24 order to give them the opportunity for another atrocity.
25 A. Yes, sir.
216
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's really the --
2 A. When the police arrived there.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well, thank you.
4 That's it, Mr Perry?
5 MR PERRY: Thank you very much, sir.
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, nine and a half, I suppose.
7 Would that be a convenient moment? All right.
8 MR HILLIARD: Sir, after the jury have gone, can I mention
9 timing?
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, please, I was thinking about that.
11 Ladies and gentlemen, we will let you go and would
12 you like to be back, please, at 10 o'clock tomorrow.
13 Thank you.
14 (In the absence of the jury)
15 Discussion re: timetabling
16 MR HILLIARD: It's only to say that, tomorrow, at the minute
17 on the list appears Mr Boutcher to finish and Mr Horwell
18 has indicated that he will be between an hour and
19 an hour and a half. Then there is Mr Johnston, who is
20 on the list to come. Plainly we are going to need more
21 than that to fill the day, so it's really just to
22 indicate that we are going to try to see if Mr Whiddett
23 and Mr Lewindon are available tomorrow, which will then
24 give us a full day tomorrow.
25 Then, given that we are sitting Friday, in fact we
217
1 will not be so far off track after all.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You have about another four to pick up.
3 MR HILLIARD: I think what will happen is that by the end of
4 Friday we will be Inspector ZAJ and Inspector Rose
5 adrift. That's a lot better than it looked at some
6 stages.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: All right. Can I simply pick up what
8 I raised with Mr Horwell and Mr Perry: I would be
9 grateful if certainly those representing the various
10 police interests could bear in mind that, because their
11 interests are -- not entirely but to some extent --
12 identical or at least similar, to try between yourselves
13 to distribute the burden of cross-examination, simply so
14 that overlapping can be avoided.
15 The one thing I do want to avoid is people asking
16 the same questions over and over again from what is, for
17 practical purposes, the same point of view.
18 MR HILLIARD: Plainly that has obviously not happened today
19 at all.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I would be most grateful to everybody
21 if you could bear that in mind.
22 MR HILLIARD: Yes.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you very much. 10 o'clock
24 tomorrow.
