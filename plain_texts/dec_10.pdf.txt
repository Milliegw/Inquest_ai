3 (Proceedings delayed)
4 (10.07 am)
5 (In the absence of the jury)
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: So far as I know, there is nothing to
7 deal with, except the adjustment of the majority
8 figures.
9 MR HILLIARD: Absolutely right.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Silence imports assent. Very well.
11 Thank you.
12 (10.10 am)
13 (In the presence of the jury)
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
15 The only thing I need to direct you about this morning
16 is to modify the direction I gave you yesterday about
17 the majority verdict in the light of the change in your
18 numbers.
19 Can I repeat the direction I gave you yesterday:
20 that if at all possible you should, if you can, return
21 verdicts and decisions with which you are all in
22 agreement so that all of you can sign the inquisition
23 document. But if, having done the best you can, you
24 cannot, I can now accept from you a decision upon
25 which -- or any decision upon which at least eight of
1
1 you are agreed.
2 So it's ten to none, nine to one, or eight to two.
3 It's again obviously desirable that your decisions are
4 unanimous ones if that is possible, so that all ten of
5 you can sign the inquisition document. If you can't,
6 the position is the same as it was yesterday, modified
7 as to numbers.
8 I can accept majority decisions of, as I say, nine
9 to one or eight to two, so long as the nine or the eight
10 are the same in relation to all the decisions about
11 which you have reached that majority agreement.
12 Again as I said to you yesterday, there is no
13 pressure, you are under absolutely no pressure, even
14 though you have lost one of your number, so take as long
15 as you need to arrive at these agreements; and I will
16 ask you now please to withdraw with your ushers and
17 continue your deliberations.
18 (10.12 am)
19 (The jury retire)
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you all.
21 (10.13 am)
22 (Court rise)
23 (4.30 pm)
24 (In the absence of the jury)
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I will repeat what I have been
2
1 told: they're discussing a point and they will be two
2 minutes.
3 (In the presence of the jury)
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, I think probably 4.30, after
5 a full day, is just about enough. I am quite happy to
6 let you go home at this point, with, if I may say so,
7 the usual warnings -- I hope I don't need to repeat them
8 all over again, it is the same warnings that I have
9 given you all the time. I don't know how you're getting
10 on and I am not asking, I don't want to be told.
11 What I would want to know is: do you think it would
12 be helpful if you started earlier tomorrow?
13 THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY: Yes.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It might make a difference?
15 THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY: Yes.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: 9.30. In that case, I am not
17 unswearing the jury bailiffs, they still remain
18 nominally in charge of you, but you're free to go and we
19 will meet again at 9.30 in the morning.
20 (4.33 pm)
21 (The court adjourned until the following day at 9.30 am)
