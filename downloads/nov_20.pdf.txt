4 (9.45 am)
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Good morning, everybody. I would hope
6 you have had a nice break but it might be thought to be
7 in bad taste.
8 One or two things before we start. I hope everybody
9 received and has taken on board the letter of
10 17 November, this Monday's letter from Barlows about the
11 way in which I intend to deal with these sessions. May
12 I also ask you all to take on board the fact that I am
13 about to make and in fact will make now an order under
14 the Contempt of Court Act in relation to the reporting
15 of these oral submissions and also of any ruling that
16 I may make hereafter. Those matters are not to be
17 reported until after verdicts are in.
18 Mr Hilliard?
19 MR HILLIARD: Sir, the only other thing is that, following
20 on from that, the transcript of the arguments that we
21 are about to have shouldn't go on the website and won't,
22 of course, also go in the transcript bundles which are
23 in fact being prepared for the jury. We may have to
24 come back to that and mention that again, but that's
25 just for completeness' sake.

1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you. Yes, Mr Mansfield.
2 MR MANSFIELD: Sir, good morning.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Good morning. First of all, can I also
4 thank everybody, including you, Mr Mansfield, and
5 Ms Hill for the very helpful, very full submissions that
6 I have received. I am very grateful to you all for the
7 work you have put in.
8 Yes.
9 Submissions by MR MANSFIELD
10 MR MANSFIELD: Sir, yes, I am indebted to those who sit
11 beside and behind me for the preparation that has been
12 done on paper.
13 May I start with a few preparatory matters. Again,
14 bearing in mind the timetable that you have set, what we
15 have prepared for this morning, although I am not going
16 to go through it in detail but in order to save time, is
17 really two documents. I think you have been handed one,
18 and everybody else has just received one. Can I just
19 indicate what it is? (Handed). The top document which
20 is unpaginated but has paragraph numbers -- well,
21 perhaps it is paginated.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Is this the smaller one?
23 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, four pages.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
25 MR MANSFIELD: That is directed towards part of the letter
3
1 that was sent asking for us to consider the narrative
2 aspect of this inquest. I appreciate that some time has
3 been set aside tomorrow, but bearing in mind there may
4 be pressure on that time, we thought it advisable, at
5 least on paper, to put down the questions, both factual
6 and contributory factors. You will see it's in two
7 parts.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
9 MR MANSFIELD: Which we suggest for your consideration and
10 for the jury's consideration, whether or no specific
11 short-form verdicts are left. In other words, they are
12 questions which we say --
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That is how I wish to approach these
14 submissions, that is to say to cover both these aspects.
15 MR MANSFIELD: I had anticipated you might, and what I have
16 to say which follows, which is hopefully a distillation
17 and an interweaving of the law and the facts as we
18 submit, has this narrative as a back cloth; in other
19 words, many of the points that I will be making not only
20 relate to specific verdicts but also relate to this
21 narrative.
22 Sir, the factual questions, if you will excuse me,
23 I am not going to read it all out --
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: They seem to me to follow very closely
25 the submissions my counsel have made.
4
1 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, the answer to that is they do, except
2 they are more extensive.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
4 MR MANSFIELD: Paragraph 4 are fairly obvious questions that
5 relate to what happened in the carriage, and the
6 contributory factors obviously are wider in the sense
7 that they start before that point in time, and the
8 failures are set out as questions right through three
9 pages, but by glancing down, you will see the nature of
10 those questions, failures in many cases by the command
11 team in relation to their responsibilities.
12 May I just pick out one because it will come back in
13 the submissions I am about to make. For example, 5.5:
14 "Failure by the command team to ensure effective and
15 immediate control and containment of Scotia Road."
16 We say that's a particularly important question and
17 is one which I will allude to shortly. But I will not
18 read out the others because they are easy to read.
19 They do follow, we have tried to do it in
20 a chronological fashion from before the decision on the
21 day through to the decision on the day.
22 Then a final paragraph indicating the kind of
23 phraseology --
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I only point out that the Court of
25 Appeal -- not the Court of Appeal, the admin court has,
5
1 I think on one occasion, said that a three-page
2 questionnaire is not necessarily a good idea.
3 MR MANSFIELD: Yes. I think there are differing views about
4 obviously --
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I see a wry grin on Ms Hill's face.
6 MR MANSFIELD: I think there is no, obviously no bar, and
7 this could all be contained, if I may say so, probably
8 if typed on a different way, on two pages.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's not an invitation.
10 MR MANSFIELD: So we will endeavour -- we really have tried
11 to limit the questions, which actually are on two pages,
12 the contributory factors, to the barest minimum, and we
13 have not picked out all the --
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It would be your submission, I suppose,
15 that these are relevant questions or relevant factors
16 for the jury to consider, whatever the limit and extent
17 of the duty of care may be.
18 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, that's right.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, all right.
20 MR MANSFIELD: In other words these are to satisfy, if you
21 like, the Article 2 Middleton approach which there are
22 questions to which the family and others are entitled to
23 have answers, that bear upon the death. So we have been
24 very careful to ensure that these are questions that
25 relate to the causes of death.
6
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: So long as they are relevant and
2 causative.
3 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, certainly.
5 MR MANSFIELD: So that's the framework of how that's been
6 revised and hopefully that will shorten matters in terms
7 of the time available tomorrow.
8 I am certainly, and I think certainly I have been
9 approached by one other counsel this morning, if it's
10 necessary for counsel, as it were, to sit round a table
11 and see if these questions or some of them can be
12 agreed, obviously that would shorten it even more.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That would be extraordinarily helpful,
14 yes.
15 MR MANSFIELD: I made it clear I'm very happy to do that.
16 The second part of this document, I am afraid is
17 a bit longer, but it's intended in fact conversely to
18 save time. Because rather than asking you constantly to
19 get out a transcript bundle in order to demonstrate
20 certain points, what we have done here is to put
21 extracts that I would have wanted you to look at all in
22 one bundle. It's paginated. So everybody is clear, I'm
23 sorry it's only been available this morning but
24 everybody has had the transcripts before. They relate
25 to C12, C2, Ralph, TJ84, Purser, and Ivor.
7
1 One of the reasons for wanting to do that at this
2 stage is because, looking at the way submissions have
3 been put, clearly in some cases our position has been
4 seriously misrepresented as to what we are actually
5 saying, and so that it's clear that our position has
6 been put throughout and exactly what we are saying,
7 I have had the sections, particularly TJ84, which is
8 lengthy, but it does spell out precisely what we are
9 saying and not the position as described in part in
10 the Commissioner's submissions as to what our position
11 is.
12 I am sorry to have to do that, but I'll come back to
13 that if I may.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Probably the most convenient way of
15 doing it.
16 MR MANSFIELD: So those are the transcripts.
17 One other introductory matter, just so that it's
18 clear at this stage: you will have been provided,
19 I think everyone has been provided yesterday or the day
20 before, with a bundle of statements from Mr Edwards and
21 DCI Southworth.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: About the time that they can get at the
23 DVLA.
24 MR MANSFIELD: Yes. We would ask that this is read into the
25 evidence in front of the jury because --
8
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Is it not sufficient for Mr Hilliard
2 simply to tell the jury that further investigations have
3 elicited this fact? As long as it's in front of the
4 jury in some form.
5 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, I think because it is a correction, and
6 we submit it's a very important correction because --
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, it's your point about
8 availability of photographs(?).
9 MR MANSFIELD: Yes. So the simple point is that --
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Does anybody have any problems about
11 this?
12 MR HORWELL: No, sir.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I didn't think there would be. One too
14 many questions from me as usual.
15 MR MANSFIELD: Well, I think it took us all by surprise --
16 it certainly took me by surprise, I can't speak for
17 others, that there was no method with the authorities,
18 despite the fact that they are notoriously slow with
19 private individuals.
20 But on an emergency of this kind, there was no way
21 of obtaining that information much more quickly. The
22 short point is that of course the DVLA photograph would
23 have been available before 9.30 --
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: About an hour and a half, according to
25 the evidence, it takes to get it. Yes.
9
1 MR MANSFIELD: So if somebody between 5 and 6 had asked for
2 it, it would have been there between 7 and 8 in the
3 morning, so a good, probably, two hours before, and it
4 could have been distributed to teams that had not yet
5 left, never mind the one in position.
6 It bears upon of course the narrative questions that
7 we ask which are set out there about obtaining better
8 images but it doesn't have very great bearing on what
9 I want to develop this morning. So I won't return to
10 that at this stage.
11 May I just introduce it by indicating that what I am
12 seeking to do, given again the time framework, is to
13 marry up an evidential framework with the legal
14 principles which we say apply, so that it's hopefully
15 a little easier to understand why we say certain
16 principles do apply, because one has to look and see
17 what the matrix of fact is that lies behind it.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Can I interrupt you a moment, something
19 you said is slightly nagging at me. You are talking
20 about submissions tomorrow. Are you intending to break
21 yours up?
22 MR MANSFIELD: No, I am doing it all in one. But I notice
23 that there was an hour and a half reserved tomorrow.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I see, for discussions, yes, that's
25 really what I was thinking about, to give everybody the
10
1 opportunity to consider the forms of questions, yes.
2 MR MANSFIELD: I thought it was sensible to put out the
3 forms of questions first so everybody could see where we
4 are coming from as a precursor to the discussions
5 tomorrow. No, I am dealing with it all in one. But
6 I think it will be clear as I go through how the factual
7 questions and the legal principles also link up with the
8 narrative because they are obvious stages, so it will be
9 clear.
10 In a sense, I want to start, if I may, at the end
11 and I want to start with, I would submit, a very strong
12 factual obvious situation, but it can get in a sense
13 side-stepped and marginalised because it is so obvious.
14 Once it's stated, I think it has a great bearing on
15 perhaps one of the biggest issues that we all face and
16 you face in terms of the law, and that is the question
17 about a duty of care being owed.
18 There are many other questions, but plainly a lot of
19 time has been consumed on that issue.
20 The factual point at which I want to start is really
21 what happened in the carriage just for one second, in
22 fact 10 seconds, in fact less than the time I have just
23 spoken over the last few sentences. In other words, we
24 are dealing with an innocent member of the public who is
25 deliberately killed; and I leave aside how much warning.
11
1 On anybody's view it's hardly any warning. We say no
2 warning of course. But even on anybody's view, within 5
3 to 10 seconds having been targeted by the police, it's
4 not an accidental shooting, between 9.33 and 10.04, it's
5 roughly half an hour that he has been targeted, and then
6 effectively deliberately shot in those circumstances.
7 I think for -- it's as serious as of course the
8 bombs themselves, and members of the public plainly, we
9 say, not only are right to be concerned about the bombs
10 themselves. There is also the other side -- and I have
11 put it to a number of witnesses -- that they are
12 entitled to be reassured about their right to life, and
13 therefore the question we pose on the facts is: is it
14 really to be argued, as I appreciate it is being argued,
15 with some qualifications by your own team but certainly
16 by all the others, that effectively there is no duty of
17 care to that innocent citizen by the forces of the
18 State; and we say put in that rather stark relief, that
19 that is an utterly untenable situation, that there is no
20 duty of care where the police are entrusted with fatal
21 force and weapons of the kind which they had.
22 Not only is it utterly untenable, the law doesn't
23 turn its face against this situation at all, and in one
24 sense the cases that we have cited on paper, and that's
25 in the original submissions we were making, make clear
12
1 a number of points.
2 Now, there are plainly two categories within this:
3 namely the category of case where the courts have said
4 that there is an inherently dangerous situation once you
5 have entrusted someone with a firearm or other dangerous
6 article. But in fact I do not, as you will see in one
7 moment, I am not just relying on that rather obvious
8 statement; in other words that the use, the deployment
9 and the use of dangerous articles by the police -- and
10 I concentrate on them at the moment -- in a sense
11 dictates a duty of care. Because it is at the highest
12 level of risk, there is -- and nobody I think is arguing
13 the converse -- an obvious foreseeability of death once
14 you have loaded weapons placed on the streets of London
15 or anywhere else for that matter.
16 However, we can go further than that in this
17 particular case. We say in fact there ought to be, and
18 we say that's why these cases which we have cited
19 indicate it, essentially a strong public policy in
20 favour of a duty where you are having armed police on
21 the streets. And of course one knows historically the
22 British police customarily haven't been armed. So where
23 you are going to go and provide this facility, we say it
24 quite obviously does raise a duty.
25 Now, I do not list the cases for the moment. If
13
1 I may just go on, that's proposition number 1,
2 inherently dangerous, and the courts have recognised the
3 inherent danger of that situation.
4 But then one moves to a further situation here, and
5 may I distill the second category that even without that
6 obvious initial proposition, if you turn to the second
7 category, if you like, the Caparo principles, then you
8 have a situation here which we say fits well within the
9 principles in any event.
10 May I distill the, so it fits the facts of this
11 case, how we would submit it, is this: that where
12 a positive operational decision -- and so it's clear,
13 can I interweave what I am suggesting, it may be
14 obvious, the operational decision is the one at 4.55.
15 Where there is a positive operational decision taken at
16 4.55 to mount an inherently dangerous firearms
17 operation, because that is what a MASTS situation is,
18 mobile armed support for surveillance, on an identified
19 address. In fact, it's addresses, but again not meaning
20 to exclude any, but at that stage we have submitted all
21 along that Scotia Road was prioritised, but it doesn't
22 for these purposes matter.
23 So where there is an identified address, so it's
24 21 Scotia Road -- I appreciate of course the communal
25 door point and all the rest of it, but that was
14
1 an identified address -- then that is an operation that
2 is confined. In other words, it's not dealing with
3 a wide class of people, which has been one of the main
4 concerns in a large number of the authorities, that the
5 police would be hampered in their investigation if they
6 were going to owe a wide duty of care because, of
7 course, they might end up with defensive policing, their
8 investigations may be curtailed and so on because they
9 are diverting resources, that public policy position.
10 Here we say if there is an identified address, it
11 automatically limits the category of people to whom the
12 duty is owed, and it's not going to provide the police
13 with an overwhelming public policy problem because they
14 are only being -- they are only targeting in fact, and
15 I come to the last part of this, the people, a small
16 defined class of people who are in the address,
17 obviously after 4.55 because that's when the positive
18 operational decision is taken; and the further factual
19 adjunct to this is that small defined class of people
20 inside the premises who then leave the premises.
21 So you will see hopefully straightaway that this is
22 inherently dangerous, it's a very limited class of
23 people, and we are dealing with the risk of death to any
24 one of those who leaves.
25 But of course we say that -- and if it's necessary
15
1 to employ concepts like the assumption of
2 responsibility, then we would argue that the assumption
3 of responsibility by the police begins at 4.55 when the
4 operational decision is taken against the identified
5 address. It's a responsibility towards those people,
6 and we submit that the public and public policy would
7 demand when there is weapons of this kind being
8 deployed, that it should be in that fashion.
9 But the duty, we say, continues from 4.55 all the
10 way through, and may I just at this point indicate the
11 stages I want to develop evidentially, the first one
12 being the 4.55 to 9.33 stage. The second stage at which
13 the duty is still continuing is from 9.33 to 9.39, when
14 he -- that is Jean Charles de Menezes -- is one of those
15 who actually leaves the premises and is targeted in the
16 way that you are very familiar with, and then gets on
17 a bus at about 9.39. That's stage number two.
18 So the duty continues through that, and then a third
19 stage arises where the duty, we say, is particular, and
20 that is -- I am using these times specifically -- 10.02.
21 10.02 roughly, within a few seconds, is the time at
22 which he's got off the bus and is walking past the bank,
23 before or at the time he reaches the tube station. So
24 it's either going across Binfield Road which is just by
25 the tube station, or entering the concourse, but before
16
1 he goes down the escalator. Then of course there is the
2 last stage when -- and I'll have to come to this -- the
3 order is given, the decision is finally taken to
4 intervene, and we say that's --
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The "stop him" order.
6 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, which we say actually was taken too
7 late, he was on the escalators at that time, and should
8 have been taken in a different way.
9 So that's the continuum, the four stages which we
10 say are important, through which this duty adheres, and
11 it would adhere to any other address that is eventually
12 covered in this way, for example Portnall Road where in
13 fact, as you have heard, a group of four were subjected
14 to a different kind but nevertheless an armed stop when
15 they left. In other words, the duty is owed to them as
16 well in the same way, because they are having lethal
17 force deployed, although maybe the tactic is different
18 because they were not regarded as suspects, but
19 associates. But nevertheless, the duty obviously
20 pervades there.
21 And any other address, and I do not need to go into
22 all the other ones, that may or may not have attracted
23 this kind of operation. We say this is extremely
24 important because we have, and I don't think anybody has
25 any doubt, that unfortunately this kind of operation may
17
1 have to be employed in the future, and therefore
2 certainly the citizens of London or any other city or
3 anywhere need to be reassured that there is a duty here
4 rather than an abrogation of duty, because we say the
5 law provides for it.
6 So what I am going to do in relation to this, if
7 I may, in order to hopefully not spend too long going
8 through authorities which have been very ably put
9 together for all of us in a number of volumes -- which
10 have disappeared, they were there, they have evaporated,
11 they were just behind me.
12 Can I indicate just the cases for the moment that we
13 say support the proposition concerning inherently
14 dangerous activities. I'll give the tab references but
15 I am not asking you to look at them for the moment
16 because I am anticipating that most people have either
17 read them or have them or know of them.
18 Plainly Rigby is an important authority. I know
19 people have tried to distinguish it on the basis it was
20 a siege condition but we say it has a lot of parallel
21 similarities to this. That's at tab 28.
22 Now, Rigby in fact has been preserved, if I can put
23 it that way, beyond the dicta in Hill.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It was approved in Van Colle.
25 MR MANSFIELD: I'll just do the references for the moment.
18
1 In the Hill case it was preserved in two -- well,
2 certainly a main speech, Lord Keith at page 59, that's
3 tab 27.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's in Hill, is it?
5 MR MANSFIELD: Yes. Tab 27, it's the second volume, tab 27,
6 Lord Keith at page 59, letters B to D. Impliedly
7 preserved it. And in Van Colle, the matter you have
8 just mentioned, that's also in the second volume,
9 tab 33. In the two speeches there, Lord Bingham at
10 paragraph 53 and Lord Hope at paragraph 79, who
11 specifically indicated that in this sort of case, namely
12 the Rigby type of case, would not compromise the public
13 interest in police investigating and suppressing crime.
14 I have already indicated that's how we put it in
15 relation to this case.
16 There are a series of other cases which we say are
17 illustrative of the inherent principle concerned with
18 firearms. They are Crooks in volume 3, tab 49, and in
19 fact I can, if I may, rattle through them because they
20 are one tab after another. Crooks at tab 49; Schofield
21 at tab 50; Bici -- which is the Kosovan case -- at
22 tab 51; Hartwell at tab 55, particularly where there are
23 dicta concerning the highly dangerous nature of
24 potentially lethal weapons which are easy to carry.
25 The paragraphs there that relate to it -- that is
19
1 Hartwell, at tab 53 -- are paragraphs 32 --
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Hartwell is tab 53, is it?
3 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, it is. If anyone sees I have made
4 a mistake, please say, but I think that's correct.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: At the moment I have 49, 50, 51 and 53.
6 MR MANSFIELD: That's right. That's a paragraph, sorry, in
7 Hartwell, paragraphs 32 and 33 to 35.
8 So we say that there is an established line of
9 respectable authority which indicates that that is
10 a category which applies. But even if --
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: They are all firearms cases?
12 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, they are to do with firearms, connected
13 with firearms and observations on firearms.
14 There is in fact, if I may, the only -- it may seem
15 a little strange to go to a textbook. There is O'Dwyer.
16 It's been added this morning. Tab 60 is another one.
17 It is a strikeout case, I appreciate it's probably
18 of lower authority but in fact the principle is there as
19 well. So if you add O'Dwyer, tab 60.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
21 MR MANSFIELD: There is a rather convenient summary. It's
22 in volume 3, tab 54. It's the only one I ask you to
23 look at at this stage.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Somebody had better give me my
25 bundle 3. (Pause). Yes, volume 3. Tab?
20
1 MR MANSFIELD: 54. The negligence liability of public
2 authorities. I appreciate it's only a persuasive
3 authority --
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Happily the authors are still alive.
5 MR MANSFIELD: Yes. Most certainly.
6 The reason we cite this one is that, of all the
7 textbooks, this is on the face of it the one that deals
8 with these issues in more detail than any other. So we
9 would say it's a leading academic as well as
10 practitioners' -- I do not put it higher than a guide,
11 but it does in fact in a number of paragraphs
12 conveniently, and somewhat succinctly summarise the
13 position as I have been putting it.
14 The paragraphs are 10.15, which comes at page 546,
15 cases in which the Caparo test is not applied.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Just a moment, I haven't quite got
17 there. 10.15, yes.
18 MR MANSFIELD: 10.15:
19 "In many claims against the police, the courts have
20 not considered the Caparo test and thus claimants have
21 not been required to establish a prior relationship of
22 proximity with the police and nor have the courts
23 considered whether, as a matter of public policy, a duty
24 ought to be imposed. These will, as we have noted, be
25 cases in which the imposition of a duty of care cannot
21
1 be regarded as novel, and in which it is well
2 established that a duty is owed. The principal category
3 of case to which this applies as far as the police are
4 concerned is claims that the police directly inflicted
5 physical harm on the claimant. This occurs, for
6 example, in cases in which injuries are caused directly
7 by careless driving or the discharge of firearms."
8 You will note there that Rigby is the footnote.
9 "Imposition of a duty of care is uncontroversial in
10 such cases even if the police were, at the time they
11 inflicted the injury, responding to an emergency or
12 investigating crime."
13 In a sense we say implicit in responding to
14 an emergency is almost certainly going to be battle
15 conditions; that's another factor that is taken into
16 account in terms of the standard of care. And we say
17 that is what the officers are trained for, and everybody
18 agreed, and this is what they would have to face in this
19 situation in any event. That doesn't somehow or other
20 abrogate the duty of care or the level of care.
21 Another paragraph that again alludes to this
22 position is 10.35 at page 558:
23 "Specific instances of police negligence."
24 The first heading is "Harm Caused Directly by the
25 Police":
22
1 "This section considers the potential liability of
2 the police when they cause physical harm directly
3 through their negligence. It examines liability where
4 the police cause accidents while driving, while
5 discharging firearms and where they cause physical
6 damage during a search of premises. As we suggested at
7 paragraph 10.15 above, in such cases it's not necessary
8 to consider whether there is a prior relationship of
9 proximity between the police and the claimant, or
10 whether the Hill policy grounds ought to preclude
11 imposition of a duty. It is widely recognised that the
12 police, like anyone else, have a duty to take care not
13 to perform acts that directly and physically injure
14 other people and this duty will be imposed even if the
15 police were involved in the investigation or prevention
16 of crime at the material time."
17 Then two more rather shorter paragraphs --
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That of course applies to the case,
19 I can't remember what it's called now, where the
20 complaint was that the police had entrusted a weapon to
21 an entirely unsuitable officer. You know the one I am
22 talking about.
23 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That relates to the actual discharge of
25 the weapon, as this paragraph appears to, where here of
23
1 course there is no question of negligence about the
2 discharge of a weapon. It was done deliberately.
3 MR MANSFIELD: I do want to come to the circumstances in
4 which --
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The only distinction I am drawing,
6 Mr Mansfield, is that the arguments here about the duty
7 of care are, as I understand it, focused as to whether
8 it ever engages at all and if so, at what point in the
9 story.
10 MR MANSFIELD: It's dealing with -- it's certainly dealing
11 with the deployment of firearms, if you are going to
12 entrust a firearm, certainly whether it's a drunken
13 police officer, which I think is O'Dwyer, or -- because
14 some of them happen to be police officers on police
15 officers, and one is a police officer in a fit of
16 jealousy --
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
18 MR MANSFIELD: -- sent to, I think, a public house, that's
19 the Hartwell one, and shoots somebody.
20 So the duty of care is not only in the question of
21 the discharge, but also the, as it were, handing of the
22 weapon to somebody. In other words, there is an overall
23 duty, and of course the Northern Irish cases look at
24 this and have reserved their position in relation to
25 this in the planning of an operation in which there is
24
1 a deployment.
2 So it goes from, as it were, the conveying of the
3 weapon to somebody's possession, so the police have to
4 ensure, for example, that the person to whom they give
5 the weapon is not mentally unstable, that's one of the
6 criterion, because otherwise they would be failing in
7 their duty of care because that person is likely, in
8 a moment of instability, to cause harm. So it's not
9 just at the point at which it's fired, because otherwise
10 it would absolve those who provide the arms in the first
11 place.
12 So we would say it's slightly more extensive than
13 just the discharge.
14 The next paragraph in fact, the final two
15 paragraphs, there is one at 10.39, page 560, "Discharge
16 of Firearms and Similar Devices", I appreciate it says
17 "discharge":
18 "The police owe a duty to ensure they do not harm
19 others by acting carelessly while engaged in dangerous
20 activities. This includes a duty not to harm persons or
21 property by negligently taking decisions regarding the
22 use of firearms ..."
23 Again, we say there were decisions taken here from
24 4.55 onwards which were negligent regarding the use of
25 firearms in this case or similar devices during the
25
1 course of an operation.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Just read the next sentence, if you
3 would.
4 MR MANSFIELD: Yes:
5 "The police will not, however, be held liable for
6 errors of policy, for example in determining the kinds
7 of firearm ..."
8 So for example here hollow tip or other equipment
9 the police force should fire.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The footnote draws the distinction
11 between policy and operational decisions.
12 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, and I have avoided -- and Marshall is
13 cited as well -- including in this obviously any errors
14 of policy and that applies to the narrative questions.
15 We have excluded policy and included essentially
16 operational decisions.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, I understand.
18 MR MANSFIELD: Finally paragraph 10.41:
19 "Where police fire guns during the course of
20 an operation [this is page 561], they owe a duty of care
21 to those who might be harmed."
22 Then the Northern Irish case, Farrell, is in the
23 footnote:
24 "The Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland has held
25 that soldiers seeking to prevent a crime occurring, owed
26
1 a duty of care to individuals, including suspects, who
2 might be harmed by their use of firearms, and it is also
3 apparent that the police and army owe a duty of care
4 when using firearms to control public disorder."
5 Then in fact the sentence which bears on something
6 I have just said:
7 "The police may also be held to be in breach of
8 a duty of care if they permit an individual" --
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's Hartwell.
10 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
11 "... who is known to be unstable or otherwise
12 potentially dangerous ..."
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: O'Dwyer is cited.
14 MR MANSFIELD: Sir, I have read those paragraphs, albeit
15 from a textbook, but they do summarise our position. We
16 say we are not limited by that, those series of
17 principles, because we are making it clear here, their
18 being a small and defined class and a target --
19 a positive decision to target an address, that this
20 falls within the parameters of namely, if you like,
21 a proximity, a relationship has been struck at the
22 moment the operational decision is taken all the way
23 through to the actual decision to intervene on the
24 particular individual concerned.
25 We say that the public policy is not going to be
27
1 undermined in any way in terms of the investigation and
2 suppression of crime if, in a case such as this, which
3 involves such important issues as life and death, the
4 police have to take care, we say.
5 So may I, on the back of that, I have done it fairly
6 briefly, but the idea is in fact to obviously relate it,
7 those principles, to -- maybe before I do, I think there
8 is a measure of, I hesitate to say agreement but in any
9 event in your counsels' submissions certainly, they
10 concede or appear to concede that there is a way of --
11 they use the word reconciling, I suggest there isn't
12 a need to reconcile, but in fact they do on page 16 of
13 their submissions onwards, they do appear to echo what
14 I have just been saying about the way to reconcile.
15 Perhaps if I can just deal with the paragraphs that
16 deal with this. Because we say in a situation in which
17 there is, we say a clear duty, you can direct the jury
18 there is a clear duty, but even if you find there isn't
19 a clear duty but there is a clearly arguable duty, and
20 there is evidence capable of supporting the arguable
21 duty, then it becomes a matter for the jury to decide in
22 those circumstances. That's the Willoughby case.
23 So the position here is -- can I just read the
24 relevant paragraphs? I am on page 16, the penultimate
25 bullet point on that page:
28
1 "The best way to reconcile all the above authorities
2 is to say that the police can owe a duty of care in
3 negligence in respect of various positive operational
4 decisions, particularly those which may foreseeably
5 result in harm to a defined class of persons."
6 Well, that, of course, is what I have been
7 developing.
8 "But the police do not owe a more general duty to
9 the public at large in their general functions of
10 investigating crime.
11 "In any event, a duty will only arise if the
12 requirements of foreseeability and proximity are met.
13 In many cases, the requisite relationship of proximity
14 will not exist, because the duty would be owed to
15 an unacceptably wide class of persons. In many cases,
16 it will not be possible to say that breach of
17 a particular duty may foreseeably result in harm."
18 Well, we say we meet the requirements of
19 foreseeability and proximity because of the targeting of
20 an address and eventually of a person.
21 We are not suggesting -- in the next bullet point:
22 "Therefore, in orchestrating a manhunt to find
23 a suspected suicide bomber, a senior officer does not
24 owe a duty to the whole of London to protect it against
25 an attack. Nor does he or she owe a general duty of
29
1 care in the investigation to all persons who might
2 foreseeably be affected by the results of the
3 investigation."
4 Then there is reference to Heagren, where the Court
5 of Appeal applied the principle in Hill to hold that:
6 "... a police force does not owe a duty of care to
7 make reasonable enquiries to check that information from
8 an informant is reliable before initiating an armed
9 search of premises."
10 Then these last two bullet points we say are of
11 particular relevance to the synopsis I have just
12 outlined:
13 "In the directing of firearms officers to
14 stop/challenge [or challenge] an identified individual
15 (or to storm an identified address), a senior officer
16 can owe a duty of care to that individual and others in
17 the immediate vicinity. This is analogous to the siege
18 situation in Rigby and involves a proximate
19 relationship."
20 Clearly that is the stage at which Commander Dick
21 takes the decision. I anticipate that's what it's
22 intended to refer to. Then the final one:
23 "It may also be arguable that, in the planning and
24 directing of a MASTS operation against an identified
25 address, a senior officer owes a duty to those inside
30
1 the address who may be affected (although that duty
2 might not apply to criminals or to those who are
3 actually suspects)."
4 So we say in this case the last bullet point applies
5 to Commander Dick and the command team in the control
6 room, but we have obviously specified individuals.
7 Then the last bullet point, we say, relates to the
8 4.55 decision onwards: it's an operational decision
9 against an identified address, and of course it owes
10 a duty to those inside the address, particularly who may
11 be affected -- may I put a hyphen there -- when they
12 leave, because it was intended to target them as and
13 when they leave.
14 We say, of course, the bit in parentheses doesn't
15 apply here, it is not suggested he is a criminal or he
16 was an actual suspect in the sense that that is
17 conventionally understood.
18 So we say there is a measure there to which there is
19 support for our propositions, and it's in that context,
20 if I may, I would like to, as it were, return to
21 a continued interweaving of the principles with the
22 various stages which have been outlined in our
23 submissions.
24 I do not intend to go through the written
25 submissions at all. I would like to, as it were, stand
31
1 back and try and distill what the position is and was.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Would you agree that the ambit of the
3 duty of care, or the extent of the duty of care may, to
4 some extent, be limited by the gravity of the peril that
5 is perceived? I'll give you the example. I am afraid
6 I have a pragmatic mind. I'll give you the example that
7 has crossed my mind. Suppose you have a police officer
8 who is confronted with an armed criminal who is quite
9 obviously a major threat, and the police officer
10 correctly decides, or justifiably decides that he will
11 have to fire not necessarily a critical shot, it doesn't
12 really matter, just a shot to disable the gunman and he
13 misses, and the bullet, in fact -- if you would like to
14 make it more difficult -- ricochets off a wall.
15 MR MANSFIELD: Well, it's the case ... yes.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Where does the duty of care end? Duty
17 of care doesn't apply to the man who has been shot at.
18 MR MANSFIELD: Not if he is a criminal.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I'm postulating that.
20 MR MANSFIELD: We say, and the word -- I think it's in one
21 of the passages I have just read -- "anyone in the
22 vicinity".
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I know. So you do have a duty of care,
24 do you, in respect of somebody who may foreseeably be
25 affected by the discharge of the gun?
32
1 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, in the vicinity.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, that's why I asked you: does the
3 immediacy and gravity of the peril perceived have any
4 impact on the ambit or the extent of the duty of care?
5 I think your submission would be no.
6 MR MANSFIELD: Well, no, it doesn't. It's the discharge of
7 a firearm. It's the use of -- the deployment and use of
8 a weapon that is capable of -- that is loaded and can
9 kill.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, all right. Very well. Thank you.
11 MR MANSFIELD: May I, just so that again you can see the
12 stages through which I am going, I have already mapped
13 them out, but can I just return to them in a little more
14 detail, because I think what I have been proposing and
15 putting, not that that, unless it's accepted, is of
16 great importance, but where it is accepted, I want to
17 submit it is of importance what has been developed
18 throughout the inquest on behalf of the family; and it
19 does go back, I'm afraid, to stage 1 and the strategy
20 that was set by the Gold Commander, Mr McDowall, at
21 4.55., because we say it has a direct link in fact to
22 what happened in the carriage at the end of the day.
23 Because the link is this, working back from the
24 carriage to this strategic decision: what happened in
25 the carriage should not have occurred and would not have
33
1 occurred if, of course, at the much earlier stage, and
2 we make it very clear, that Jean Charles de Menezes had
3 been stopped before he got on a bus.
4 Because without question, we submit, and have
5 submitted, that the safest time for this to have taken
6 place, and we have not been submitting that it's
7 underneath a certain tree if you turn left because you
8 don't know whether the person is going to turn left. We
9 have never ever submitted that. We are submitting that
10 the safest time for a controlled stop, to minimise the
11 risk of foreseeable death, was in that initial time, and
12 we say this was recognised by McDowall and by Dick, but
13 just not put into practice. I'm putting it in a very
14 short form.
15 The moment that opportunity is missed and past, the
16 risks are not minimised, they are maximised. Can
17 I just, before I deal with it, try and look at this with
18 feet on the ground realistically, as a police officer in
19 charge, as a Londoner. There isn't anywhere in London
20 where you are going to get conditions which allow you to
21 do exactly how you want to perform a controlled stop.
22 There is nowhere that's perfect.
23 But clearly, I think as the police themselves
24 accepted, the further someone engages with public
25 transport, in other words actually gets on a bus, which
34
1 actually can't be surrounded and hijacked by the police
2 without serious risk, or, worse, gets into the tube
3 system and on to a train, that that is a spectre that
4 cannot possibly be contemplated. Therefore, deploying
5 firearms have to be deployed at a time when they can be
6 safely or at least minimising the risk, as one
7 appreciates there is always a risk, but minimising the
8 risk of death by using them at the safest opportunity.
9 We say the safest opportunity was at the start and
10 increasingly it got more dangerous the closer it got to
11 a tube station. Now, it may be said, well, they never
12 knew he was going to get off at a tube station, but the
13 problem was that once he is on the bus, he could end up
14 much closer to central London and much closer to places
15 where it would be almost impossible, if not impossible,
16 to do a controlled stop under proper conditions,
17 particularly when you are dealing with -- come back to
18 this -- somebody who is fundamentally innocent.
19 We say that's the factual situation that was facing
20 the police, and one has to say what was the object,
21 stage one, before the strategy is set, what was the
22 object; and again, I hope it's not being naive, I hope
23 it's not being simplistic to say that once the gym card
24 is found, what is anybody going to say, whether they are
25 a Gold Commander, Silver, Bronze or a local PC; you have
35
1 a gym card, you have a photograph -- the photograph,
2 I do not make any comment about that for the moment --
3 you have a photograph, you have an address, you have two
4 individuals linked to the address, and eventually by
5 6.20 you have a car linked to that address.
6 What's going to be in the context of this case which
7 has been hammered home time and time again of what
8 happened on the day before and what happened on 7 July
9 was that the threat to London at that point -- one was
10 the highest threat probably since the wars, and higher
11 than the IRA threat, so it's the highest threat. This
12 dictates in a sense the highest duty of care where there
13 is the highest threat.
14 There is the highest threat and what is the threat
15 to? As far as the police were concerned, and the rest
16 of London, because again it's been emphasised how
17 everybody was afraid to even get on the public transport
18 system, it appeared to be not exclusively but
19 predominantly a threat to the public transport system,
20 either bus or tube, both of which had been hit on the
21 21st and the 7th.
22 So therefore it's not too sophisticated to, as it
23 were, determine that the decision that has to be taken
24 at 4.55 is the decision that was half taken, as it turns
25 out. You have to contain and control the address. Why?
36
1 Because there are two objectives. As some of the cases
2 indicate, you have to look at what is the objective of
3 the operation that is being carried out? The objective
4 is two-fold. The main one is just in case, and one
5 can't assume that they are not going to be there,
6 although we say in fact some of the senior management
7 did assume that the individuals concerned wouldn't
8 return to a footprint address.
9 However, you can't assume that. You can't allow
10 that to affect your thinking at that point at all,
11 4 o'clock in the morning. You have got a lead which is,
12 if I may put it, a hot lead. It may turn out,
13 fortunately for those perhaps in the block, that it
14 wasn't a bomb factory and that in fact no-one was there,
15 or at least the people they were looking for weren't
16 there. However at 4.00 in the morning you don't know
17 that.
18 So therefore the policy that has to be, we say,
19 pursued at that point is controlling and containing and
20 stopping anyone coming from the address that you have
21 got -- I know about the communal door which is in the
22 wings, as it were -- reaching public transport. And
23 yes, they don't know which bus stop they are going to,
24 they don't know whether they are going to turn left or
25 right, they don't know whether they are going to walk
37
1 all the way, they don't know whether they are going to
2 use a car. I have in fact contemplated all of those
3 possibilities when cross-examining various officers.
4 One of the key witnesses which I will have to come
5 to in a moment was TJ84, where I am afraid in some
6 detail all of this was put. Whether it was appreciated
7 by others who were listening, I don't know, but I have
8 canvassed all of this very carefully as to the real
9 objective here which could have been achieved without
10 a death was that first, I have called it a window or
11 parameter, and not a specific place, but a specific time
12 before engaging with public transport.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You have never challenged the
14 proposition that the beginning of the window, as it
15 were, has to be far enough away from the building to
16 avoid compromising the operation.
17 MR MANSFIELD: That's right, yes. Because I have accepted
18 that you don't want to do it outside the front door and
19 you don't want to do it probably in Scotia Road itself
20 and you may feel that Marnfield Crescent even is too
21 close in case somebody in Marnfield Crescent happens to
22 know somebody in Scotia Road.
23 So I have accepted that. But what I have not
24 accepted and what I haven't been saying is that it has
25 to be point A, B or C in Upper Tulse Hill because in
38
1 fact the window is 9.33 when he actually leaves and Pat
2 picks it up at 9.33, 9.33 and the estimate is that he
3 gets on the bus at about 9.39. That's six minutes.
4 Now, if one takes off the time between the front door
5 and Upper Tulse Hill, two, three minutes perhaps, you
6 have a three, four-minute window.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: In geographical terms, that's turning
8 into Upper Tulse Hill from Marnfield Crescent and
9 closing, what, at the bus stop?
10 MR MANSFIELD: Well, I am not going to be seduced into
11 saying a particular position because then everyone is
12 throwing back: oh, Mr Mansfield is picking out a
13 position, and how can it be ...
14 My position has been, or the family's position has
15 been, I'm sorry, that -- and certainly I do speak for
16 the family on this -- that if he had been stopped, and
17 of course it's not as it turned out, he could have been
18 stopped; and I'm going forward a little bit, since we
19 are on Upper Tulse Hill. What one has to remember in
20 that stretch between Marnfield and Tulse Hill, that
21 stretch of Upper Tulse Hill, now I know three minutes
22 doesn't sound very long but in fact in the end they were
23 taking decisions on somebody's life within seconds
24 inside the carriage, and within seconds, slightly longer
25 period, from the top of the escalator down to the train,
39
1 and of course leaving the bus. They are taking
2 decisions in a much narrower window in a more much
3 dangerous situation than Upper Tulse Hill.
4 Of course my window gets far larger if he had in
5 fact chosen to walk the other way, and for example
6 walked in the direction of either Roupell Road where
7 there was another bus stop, or even just continued on
8 Upper Tulse Hill to a bus stop off the map, as it were.
9 So that's the minimum, and if I may say so, it's not
10 rocket science for a police officer or anyone else to
11 have worked out, given the high level of threat, what is
12 the high level of response which is: we really do have
13 to stop him if he is there or anyone who might be him,
14 in other words we can't take the risk. That's been
15 appreciated in fact by Mr Horwell when he was putting
16 questions at a later stage. You can't allow anybody who
17 might be to get on to public transport, because of the
18 risk and the threat level and so on.
19 Therefore it behoves the police to take a positive
20 operational decision which maximises safety for the
21 innocent persons who might be within the address and who
22 might leave and who do leave, and in fact the category
23 of people is narrowed even further because it was in one
24 sense, because it was a communal door, and because they
25 didn't know where people were coming from, they could
40
1 only deal with those people who appeared to look like
2 one of the subjects, one of the two subjects.
3 May I say this, just in parentheses, there is
4 an interesting factual example here: I think I put it to
5 Commander Dick or certainly somebody, that had Omar, the
6 other person linked to the gym card, who was thought to
7 live there, come out of number 21, where there was a far
8 better image in fact of him than there is of Osman, he
9 was in the same position. He's totally innocent, as is
10 now conceded. But it's a very good example of yet
11 somebody else who would also have been seriously at risk
12 if he had not, for example, or rather putting it the
13 other way around, if he had got on to a bus, done the
14 same route and so on, maybe got off at a different stop,
15 but in any event, the risks are immediately seen for
16 somebody who was thought without question by the
17 Gold Commander, Mr McDowall, he thought Osman was a good
18 likeness for Warren Street. In fact they all thought
19 that.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Omar.
21 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, I am sorry, Omar, Omar was a good
22 likeness. They all thought that.
23 Therefore Omar was in a very high risk category if
24 he had have come out that morning.
25 So again it just demonstrates why there is
41
1 an extraordinary need for care here, we say, and
2 obviously a duty that is imposed because of these risks
3 of death, foreseeable risks of death, in terms of, as it
4 turns out, shooting the wrong person.
5 So that walking along that stretch of
6 Upper Tulse Hill, if one has it in mind, and I think we
7 have all been there now. The irony of it all is there
8 were sufficient resources to conduct a safe stop. Now,
9 this, I know a question that has been floating not in
10 the ether but on paper that has been posed is, you know,
11 what is the difference between the inquest and the
12 Health and Safety trial?
13 One of the big differences, and I think Mr Perry
14 himself -- I see he is not here today but anyway -- has
15 pointed out and I accept this that there is now
16 a different factual situation, at least an appreciation,
17 and I include myself in it, a different appreciation,
18 although the material may have been there to put it
19 together, nobody, without access to necessarily all the
20 phone calls and putting it carefully together, it was
21 not appreciated at the Health and Safety trial, I was
22 not involved in that, but that in fact, for example, as
23 de Menezes walked along Upper Tulse Hill past the
24 TA Centre at 9.35-ish, 36 even perhaps but somewhere in
25 that region, what was right across the road? The Alpha
42
1 car, armed CO19, had already got there. And probably
2 that's the minimum -- probably the second car, 805C, had
3 got there. The third car which was the control car,
4 probably hadn't got there because you will remember TJ84
5 and others saying that --
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Just as they turned in.
7 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, I remember.
9 MR MANSFIELD: So therefore the probability, I think I can
10 put it as high as that, the probability is there were
11 two cars there. That is four armed police officers,
12 highly trained to do a stop. We know from TJ84 and in
13 fact no-one's said that it couldn't be done, that it
14 could have been done if they were ordered to do it.
15 Even though he -- that is the control car -- may not
16 have reached there, that's not an uncommon situation, it
17 could have been done. It could have been ordered at
18 that point.
19 But it's more, as it were, amplified than that.
20 It's not just that there were two cars right there.
21 There were a number of other police officers in the
22 vicinity. In other words, this isn't a case where the
23 resources weren't actually available. The real question
24 is: why wasn't it all pulled together to happen? I am
25 coming to that.
43
1 Also, you now know that Jean Charles has walked past
2 Frank. Now, he can't leap out of his van, I appreciate
3 that. And in fact that's the trigger. He is really
4 saying, because he is incommoded, he doesn't actually
5 see precisely so he is saying worth a second or worth
6 another look. So that's how it starts, and I'm going
7 into the facts a bit of this, this is the second stage,
8 but it bears upon actually stage one and the setting of
9 the strategy.
10 What should have happened, and we say could have
11 happened, it happened with the blue team, they had it
12 absolutely sorted, if I may say so, up at Portnall Road,
13 is that you don't rely on one person, if you have only
14 got a small timeframe, same with Portnall Road, same all
15 over London; the timeframe between leaving an address
16 and hitting a bus stop or tube station is limited, even
17 the walk from here, the Oval up to either the Oval
18 Underground station that way or the overground station
19 that way, we are talking minutes only, in fact not
20 dissimilar timeframes. It doesn't matter where you are
21 in London, it's that kind of timeframe. We are
22 absolutely having to deal with that kind of timeframe.
23 Portnall Road exactly the same.
24 So what the blue team, and you have had Alpha 1 and
25 so forth give evidence here, is that if somebody had
44
1 been missed coming out of 61A, they had back-up, they
2 had someone else -- I didn't want to know where they
3 were -- ready to be able to achieve an identification or
4 not of the persons who had come out.
5 Now, there were other people, but what we don't
6 know, we don't know where they were. For the bulk of
7 the red team who were red or not red as the case may be,
8 we haven't got a clue where they were, and in fact
9 no-one else seems to know where they were except one or
10 two.
11 What is very clear is there wasn't a tight circle
12 with officers able to, as it were, do an intervention on
13 a surveillance basis because here we are dealing with
14 high risk. There is no -- you have to balance the risk
15 of a surveillance officer getting, as it were, seen
16 against allowing somebody who might be a bomber getting
17 on a bus. I think the risk of a surveillance officer
18 exposing himself is much less in terms of the damage to
19 his future use and all the rest of it, than the damage
20 to London if he is a suicide bomber getting on to a bus.
21 But what didn't happen here was no other member of
22 the red team appears to have been in a position to do
23 anything about the missed opportunity by Frank because
24 what happens is Edward is sitting in a car park right
25 opposite Marnfield Crescent, and for reasons which he
45
1 gave which at the time I didn't accept and still don't,
2 because he was not armed he didn't get out, so what, we
3 allow a risk to get further closer to a bus stop? He
4 doesn't get out of the car, and therefore he is not able
5 to help.
6 That's Edward.
7 Now, from somewhere, I think it's a road further
8 back up Upper Tulse Hill, comes Tango 2.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Too far away to interfere, he says.
10 MR MANSFIELD: Too far away to interfere. Now, that's
11 another piece of evidence that has not surfaced before.
12 He has never been asked about this. At least he never
13 made a statement, although reference had been made to
14 him by others. He is too far away. Why is he too far
15 away? It's no use being 100 metres behind so he only
16 sees the back. So that's pretty useless. He is in
17 Upper Tulse Hill, Edward's in Upper Tulse Hill. Then we
18 have Harry in a car following behind in
19 Upper Tulse Hill, so that's a third officer. Then we
20 have James and Ken in a car, driving alongside and Ken
21 gets out.
22 So between five officers, effectively, there has not
23 been -- what there should have been was tight control in
24 order effectively to say, and I'm going to put it
25 clearly, with this level of threat unless you can
46
1 discount this individual and say he's not one of the
2 bombers, suspected, in other words he's not comparable
3 to the image, because all they had to go on, this very
4 poor image in one case and a better image in the other
5 one, he doesn't appear to be either of the two we have
6 got. Then in our submission a stop has to take place
7 because of the risks involved, and could have taken
8 place there.
9 Because in fact as it turned out, James, as you
10 know, claimed that he got a fleeting glance. That's in
11 fact another of the extraordinary bases almost upon
12 which this whole case has emanated.
13 Frank missing an opportunity, have another look,
14 someone has another extraordinarily brief look across
15 a car as he is driving along and that becomes,
16 eventually for him, sufficient for him to say he
17 believes it is effectively. At the beginning he drives
18 right into Tulse Hill, turns round in a block of flats,
19 comes back down having looked at the image and is then
20 conveying "possibly", possibly identical with on the
21 basis of a poor image and a fleeting glance.
22 This really is totally unsatisfactory, and we say
23 that what should have been happening at this period,
24 tight surveillance control because they all should have
25 realised that the -- it's rather like the line in the
47
1 sand that Ivor rather graphically drew. There is a line
2 in the sand, not at the escalators, that's what he was
3 forced to do because by then it was so late in the day,
4 the line in the sand had been pushed back, pushed back,
5 pushed back, top of the escalators.
6 The line in the sand actually for a safe controlled
7 stop, and we know from Jean Charles's background that
8 whenever he has been approached by the police, there has
9 never been any problem, utter respect for them --
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, that means that had they done,
11 that's what would have happened. I appreciate that
12 entirely. But what do you say -- I fully understand the
13 points you are making about effectively intervening at
14 a time which will produce the minimum risk to people on
15 public transport.
16 MR MANSFIELD: That's right.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What do you say about the risk to the
18 officers themselves?
19 MR MANSFIELD: Oh, I say it's reduced substantially, because
20 we have not been allowed to go into the tactics, I am
21 not complaining but one is imagining, I hope, reasonably
22 inferentially that what would happen on a controlled
23 stop, a challenge and a controlled stop, which is in the
24 Kratos document, the tactical options document that was
25 provided by Andrew and Esposito to, at 11.45 that night,
48
1 and then 6.15 in the morning, was on the challenge and
2 control as opposed to a stop, which is apparently at
3 very close quarters, a challenge from a distance would
4 enable plainly -- let's suppose there were at least two
5 cars there, two cars, either the cars themselves to be
6 deployed; in other words the officers wouldn't run out
7 of the TA Centre outside their cars, that's what
8 I understand would be the situation, they would drive
9 out in cars, and within seconds they could drive
10 alongside and clearly --
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: As they did at Portnall Road.
12 MR MANSFIELD: Yes. Exactly as they did at Portnall Road,
13 although I appreciate that at Portnall Road the actual
14 intervention was of a different kind because they were
15 associates. I appreciate that.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's the other point, of course, that
17 the distinction at Portnall Road is that anybody who
18 came out of those single premises was either a suspect
19 himself or an associate.
20 MR MANSFIELD: Yes. Here it had to be narrower, so it's
21 a narrower group of people to whom the duty is owed.
22 It's anybody who appears to look like --
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
24 MR MANSFIELD: So it's a really narrow group.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The reason I asked you the question,
49
1 Mr Mansfield, is the rather striking evidence that Neil
2 gave when he was asked: how do you approach a suicide
3 bomber? One could have thought of the old music hall
4 joke answer, but what he actually said was only when he
5 is stripped naked and lying flat on the floor. I don't
6 think one ought to lose sight of the fact that the
7 officers themselves must be conscious of the fact that
8 any approach to somebody who is feared to be a suicide
9 bomber may involve appalling risks to the officers
10 themselves.
11 MR MANSFIELD: Or may not, it depends how it's -- of course
12 there is a risk. There is an even bigger risk, we say,
13 in the way that it actually was carried out. Obviously
14 I am going to come to that.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: We have not got there yet. I'm talking
16 about your postulated intervention in Upper Tulse Hill.
17 MR MANSFIELD: And I am saying that would have constituted
18 the minimal risk, it doesn't exclude it, the minimal
19 risk to all concerned, that is the person being stopped,
20 people who live in adjoining premises; at that time of
21 day nobody has suggested the pavements were crowded in
22 Upper Tulse Hill. They would probably have been
23 sparsely populated and they would have done what Ralph
24 indicated he would have done in Binfield Road where
25 there were people. In other words you form a ring.
50
1 It's not difficult to get people to, as it were,
2 understand they are armed police because if they are
3 shouting "armed police" as they should do properly in
4 a controlled situation above ground, and they come in
5 and form a circle because they are obviously disciplined
6 and know how to do it. Because I haven't been able to
7 ask them exactly what the tactic is, I understand that
8 they would form a ring and they would challenge,
9 shouting "armed police" and they would make
10 a instruction, because "armed police" isn't enough, you
11 would have to say, as Andrew actually spelt it out,
12 which would be "stand still, show me your hands". It
13 can be said in a matter of seconds.
14 There is a risk of course in that situation, and the
15 risk is in the split second if there is what is called
16 non-compliance or perceived to be non-compliance in
17 relation to that kind of challenge, then of course the
18 guidance has been that you made of your own volition.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The risk is, and on the evidence this
20 is what would happen if he is a bomber, is they are
21 dead.
22 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Because he will detonate.
24 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's it, isn't it?
51
1 MR MANSFIELD: Yes. I accept all of that. It's because we
2 are dealing with knife-edge split-second situations.
3 This doesn't mean to say that, oh well we can't expect
4 police officers or anybody else for that matter, but
5 police officers to have a standard of care that is
6 really impossible. We are saying quite the reverse.
7 It's why I have said to many of the officers, and they
8 have accepted, they are highly trained to deal with, on
9 their firing ranges and elsewhere, precisely a situation
10 which happens in the blinking of an eye, somebody coming
11 through a door which they do in conventional situations
12 where certainly in the case of Bennett, which I was
13 involved in, where they had to go very quickly in an
14 armed response vehicle in that case, very quickly indeed
15 on a report that somebody had been seen with a gun. It
16 turned out to be an imitation gun. It was a lighter.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Cigarette lighter.
18 MR MANSFIELD: And he ended up on a balcony, and the
19 officers had to run up a pathway on to the balcony and
20 he took -- within seconds he had taken or appeared to
21 take a hostage. They had moments to decide what to do.
22 This is not something, as it were, unpredictable, they
23 are having to take difficult decisions.
24 So that plainly, the situation of pressure,
25 fast-moving dynamic situations are regular, but my
52
1 position is that in Upper Tulse Hill, or if he turned
2 right a longer period in Upper Tulse Hill or
3 Roupell Road or whichever way he had turned, if he had
4 left by car, clearly they had provision for that,
5 because that's in the tactical options. There was
6 a Nissan, they would have known, and of course that
7 would have made it possibly an even stronger connection,
8 because the car had the connections that they had
9 already written down in their notebooks.
10 Therefore if they had gone in a car, that would have
11 been possible to stop. They had vehicles to do that as
12 well. So I have not limited it to leaving on foot,
13 haven't limited it to leaving in a car either. And of
14 course he could have gone in any direction. But the
15 point is, if you are going to prevent this person
16 wreaking havoc in London, whether via the use of a car
17 or public transport, it has to be done as near to the
18 address as possible without compromising the address.
19 After that, you have an unplanned, unpredictable
20 situation. The one predictable situation they had was
21 the one they were planning for, the one that surrounds
22 the address, and that's why we say because they have
23 better control, because they are there without the
24 knowledge of the people inside, they are there with the
25 resources without the knowledge of the people inside,
53
1 and this was the concern of surveillance officers and
2 others, that once the person is allowed to run, you
3 could lose them.
4 That's all right if they are not actually somebody
5 who might be regarded, even might be regarded, as
6 a suicide bomber. In other words if you can be sure
7 they are a suspect -- I'm so sorry, an associate or
8 somebody who might give you intelligence, maybe you do
9 let them run.
10 But even then there is an unhappiness about letting
11 them run too far because you spread your resources very
12 thin. So we say the emphasis has to be on what I have
13 called the window at the beginning. And that the answer
14 to why things didn't happen there is not just that those
15 on the ground, the CO19 weren't alerted, which we say
16 they should have been, the surveillance were not
17 focusing on a job they absolutely had to do before the
18 bus stop, knowing -- well they didn't know that he was
19 going to a bus stop but the possibility that he might be
20 going to a bus stop round the corner and that that was
21 one of the risks, that that tight surveillance and
22 control should have been, as it were, their top
23 priority, in order to enable the command team to take
24 a decision whether to intercept because they were taking
25 the decisions.
54
1 If you are not going to have, as it were, a command
2 team on the ground for all the reasons that have been
3 examined on the policy basis as to why it has to be at
4 New Scotland Yard, then you just absolutely have to have
5 reliable information communicated efficiently so that
6 that decision can be taken.
7 Now, this goes back, and if I can step back for
8 a moment, I am watching, sir, the clock slightly, to
9 what happened at 4.55. Can I just, before perhaps the
10 first break, take you to the strategy decision. I know
11 it's been gone over many times but in fact it's a very
12 important decision for a number of reasons. It's
13 because this decision was not implemented effectively
14 that the resources that were available in the end at
15 Scotia Road didn't swing into action in the way that
16 they should have done. In other words there is a duty
17 of care and it was not, as it were, implemented. The
18 duty of care wasn't implemented.
19 I have it at documents page 1858.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Is this in the bundle you have just
21 given me?
22 MR MANSFIELD: No, it isn't, actually, I'm sorry. It's the
23 handwritten version of his notes. I have used that
24 because it's perhaps a more -- it's on screen, thank you
25 very much, the command team have reproduced it. It
55
1 should have been on the screen.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you.
3 MR MANSFIELD: It's one of the few documents, I'm trying to
4 avoid using too many documents.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, I remember this.
6 MR MANSFIELD: This one is so important because we say, if
7 one looks at it as a whole, the seeds of its own
8 destruction are here. It's a very well-intended
9 decision, but it's not thought through. And it's
10 certainly not implemented. Had it been, once again,
11 what happened at the beginning, the best opportunity
12 stage at 9.33, we say was utterly avoidable if somebody
13 had considered, and we say Gold Commander, had
14 considered it.
15 His strategy in respect of premises, plural,
16 I appreciate there is two in mind and I am not going to,
17 for these purposes, go into exactly when Portnall Road
18 came onstream and so on, a short time afterwards, it
19 did. In fact for the purposes of this submission it
20 doesn't really matter and I'll explain why it doesn't.
21 What he has put here is extremely important in the
22 first place:
23 "Control, challenge, stopped."
24 Now, control, challenge and stop, utterly
25 commonsensical things to do. You have got the gym card.
56
1 You know the address. It's linked to two people. You
2 have got July 7th where rucksacks have got the
3 identities of the people who had carried out the
4 bombings, and here we are again with more rucksacks with
5 identities. There is a very strong premise that the
6 identification materials relate to the person who
7 committed the bombing, and there is a link to this
8 address.
9 So all of that makes sense. So he is wanting
10 a control, a challenge and a stop. Now, of course it
11 doesn't say precisely where there, but he has made
12 clear, and it is made clear later by Commander Dick,
13 that these were not people who were going to be allowed
14 to run. It had to be at or near the premises so that
15 the operation isn't compromised, but so that you don't
16 get a situation where the public are endangered, either
17 on public transport or elsewhere.
18 So they are having to be stopped, that's the rider.
19 Now, it plainly, although not written here, was intended
20 that the stops involved an armed element, component, and
21 the W is "with" SO19. So from that moment onwards, that
22 is the element, even though they may not arrive
23 immediately because of the difficulties I am coming to
24 in a moment.
25 But that's plainly what was in mind.
57
1 So if you are taking a decision to deploy, by which
2 I mean send out into the field, an armed resource with
3 loaded weapons, with the possibility they will actually
4 be used and could actually have been discharged in
5 relation to a stop, because of the prime concern is one
6 of the two people who they think may be concerned with
7 the devices the day before may be inside the premises.
8 So far, so good. And of course the little word that
9 is added there "recce", reconnaissance, absolutely
10 vital, we say, and he obviously thought so too, that
11 there should be a reconnaissance. I am not going to go
12 through the niceties of whether it happens just before
13 the firearms arrive or after they have got there.
14 Somebody's got to look at the layout of the ground.
15 They have to look at the premises. You are certainly
16 going to do that if the Metropolitan Police aren't
17 actually going to bother with maps -- I know I have been
18 on about this in terms of the command team. It seems
19 fortunately that the firearms teams are slightly more
20 organised and they have maps and they go done and they
21 obviously do want to know, unlike the command team,
22 exactly where everything is.
23 So that asking for a reconnaissance, asking for the
24 involvement of SO19, all of that line, if that had been
25 put into practice, we say immediately. Now, by that
58
1 I do not mean at 4.55 and it's all there by 5.15.
2 Impossible.
3 But what we do know is possible, and I am coming to
4 this, is that there should have been a structure in
5 place either at the moment he took this strategic
6 decision or very shortly afterwards, which was ensuring
7 the implementation on the ground in Scotia Road, by
8 which I mean the vicinity, with all the elements that
9 were going to be necessary, as soon as practicable,
10 which would be surveillance, firearms back-up, SO13, all
11 within the vicinity.
12 Now, is that asking too much when London is facing
13 the highest threat ever? Are we going to sit on our
14 seats and say: well, we are not quite sure whether this
15 is the right address. There may be another one coming
16 up. No. We say it was appreciated, it was the top
17 priority, this address and perhaps another one, but they
18 had resources that could cope with both.
19 The problem here is in the next sentence, because
20 what perhaps unconsciously or consciously has gone wrong
21 here is that Mr McDowall is locked into a framework
22 which has been set the previous night, and the framework
23 that was the contingency the previous night was in fact
24 for there to be a standby team and a DSO standby as
25 well, but that 7 o'clock was the customary rostered time
59
1 for the black team to come on, 7 o'clock in the morning.
2 So in almost an unconscious way, the problem is
3 everybody was working to 7 o'clock, save -- I am coming
4 to Alan -- obviously what Alan attempted to do, but he
5 wasn't the right person to do it. Because the second
6 part of the sentence:
7 "Silver to be identified each plot."
8 I am going to call that the location Silver.
9 Now, the location Silver, can I just pause for
10 a moment, if I may call it that, I now understand they
11 have been renamed and the location Silver is called
12 a Bronze. But really I am not concerned in the title,
13 but the role that he is performing.
14 Location Silver is important because as Mr Purser
15 accepted when I asked him these questions, he is not
16 there just as a firearms Silver in a MASTS operation,
17 and this seems to have been forgotten. A location
18 Silver is there to co-ordinate -- which didn't happen --
19 all the resources required for a particular location.
20 Co-ordinate in the sense of on the ground.
21 So he has an overview of what the red team, as it
22 turned out and the grey team, are doing. He doesn't
23 need to know where every individual officer is. He
24 needs to know where the premises are. He needs to know
25 there is a communal door. He needs to know the
60
1 possibilities of exit from that area. He needs to know
2 that the red team are in a position to deal with it. He
3 needs to know the grey team are in a position to have
4 tight control, and -- and this all comes through
5 a briefing which didn't actually happen like this,
6 because it was all done piecemeal. So the location
7 Silver has to have an overview of surveillance, firearms
8 and SO13 because it should be a co-ordinated, control,
9 challenge and stop.
10 You will see what he says here:
11 "To identify each plot, to liaise with Silver,
12 DSO..."
13 That's Cressida Dick.
14 You begin to see the problem here. What is
15 happening is, and we will see it in practice, that it's
16 all delayed to the 7 o'clock timing save for the efforts
17 of Alan which become bogged down, if I may say, in
18 malcommunication inside New Scotland Yard is that if --
19 they have to be identified for each plot and liaise with
20 Dick. Well, what's happening to Cressida Dick at this
21 time? Cressida Dick has been notified at 1.30 she is
22 going to be needed. What was interesting in the phone
23 call, if you recall, she said, "I was asked to come in
24 at 5".
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: A voice in the background --
61
1 MR MANSFIELD: A voice in the background said 7. In fact
2 she did get in early, between 5 and 6, well before 6.
3 So what was happening then at 1.30 people were still
4 locked into -- that's not a criticism -- 7 o'clock
5 because the black rostered team was coming on then.
6 If in fact he is contemplating a liaison with the
7 DSO, Cressida Dick, well, she is not going to actually
8 be taking over until 7 because that is when she has been
9 asked to come in. As it happened, as I have said, she
10 was in New Scotland Yard shortly after 5 and certainly
11 before 6. So you can begin to see how this is not
12 taking off as it should have done. Then it's got:
13 "Consult Commander Carter."
14 Who is on the next floor down, DSO dealing with
15 spontaneous Kratos. Then:
16 "Update according to developing intelligence."
17 That's obviously sensible, and "update" is
18 an important word because we say also that's
19 a responsibility he has.
20 Now, perhaps just before the break, if I can deal
21 with what actually happened here. What actually
22 happened was that Alan was present at some point, and
23 the time doesn't matter much except that at an early
24 stage, and he made a contemporaneous note, he did
25 understand that Scotia Road had been prioritised. It
62
1 may be unnecessary for these purposes to try to, and we
2 have not put it in the narrative because we accept that
3 perhaps trying to discern exactly what went wrong here
4 and who said what to whom may not be at the end of the
5 day the most important causative factor. The most
6 important causative factor was that the structures were
7 not put in place at Scotia Road such that, from, we say,
8 6 o'clock, surveillance, 7 o'clock latest, firearms, and
9 location Silver was not in place.
10 If it had been in place, then by the time
11 Jean Charles de Menezes left at 9.33, there would have
12 been a very -- well, I put it no higher, the best
13 opportunity and possibility for tight control of
14 surveillance and command in order to stop, as it's set
15 out in the strategy, somebody who's left and who then
16 becomes of interest to the resources that are deployed
17 and in particular the command team.
18 Now, that could have happened. That could have
19 happened if Commander McDowall had done his job. We say
20 his job wasn't just to set the strategy. Now, the
21 command team have made a very interesting point about
22 McDowall. They are saying he can't be, as it were,
23 roped into the duty of care because he didn't implement
24 it. That is precisely the point we are making. He
25 didn't implement it and he should have done. Not
63
1 himself. He doesn't run round doing it.
2 His obligation is to make sure that somebody does
3 implement it, and, since he is on the job and remains on
4 the job and he has accepted this, I put it to McDowall
5 in the very early stages, he accepted unequivocally that
6 it was his responsibility to ensure that his policy was
7 implemented. Otherwise it makes no sense.
8 You can't just, as it were, as a commander, in any
9 business, sit, you know, on the roof of the building and
10 issue instructions like confetti and then hope that they
11 land in the right place and the right people are doing
12 them, because we all know that's not actually how it
13 works on the ground. That is why commanders or
14 executives or whoever they happen to be have to follow
15 it through, and it's the common question: have you done
16 what I asked you to do? That's a very simple question.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's the way you put it.
18 MR MANSFIELD: That's the way I put it and he has accepted
19 that.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: In fact a direct involvement in the
21 execution of his instructions by his delegates.
22 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, and he was present through, he had come
23 back from a rest, no-one is denying that, so by the time
24 he has issued the strategy at 4.55 he is almost in
25 continuous contact with different people between 5 and
64
1 the crucial meeting at 7, and one at 20 to 7.
2 So there he is meeting all the people, and I have
3 obviously put it to him so I am not saying anything that
4 I have not put to him: why on earth didn't you say,
5 how's it going or have you got there yet? This is not
6 hindsight. This is absolutely not hindsight, given the
7 level of threat you might think that somebody would want
8 to know, because how do you know when they are going to
9 leave, once you have set the strategy. They could be
10 leaving 5.30, 6.30, 7.30, 8.30.
11 The idea that people sit back and don't ask that
12 question is, we say, astonishing, and if the word has to
13 be used, gross, I use the word gross; it is a gross
14 omission by those at the top not to ensure that this is
15 being followed through. Would that be a useful time for
16 a break?
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you very much. Shall we say 25
18 to.
19 (11.25 am)
20 (A short break)
21 (11.40 am)
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
23 MR MANSFIELD: So what would have happened or could have
24 happened, I'm so sorry, here, after 4.55 and we say
25 should have happened and it wasn't difficult to arrange
65
1 is first of all you have to have in place in New
2 Scotland Yard to implement it a central Silver,
3 an operations room Silver.
4 Now this post is accepted as being necessary.
5 No-one is contesting that that is necessary. He has not
6 put it in his strategy but it is necessary. The person
7 who would fit that category had gone off, Mr Boutcher.
8 When the jury were given, at the very beginning of the
9 inquest, a diagram of posts and roles, he was down as
10 the control room Silver. Anyway, he was not there, and
11 Mr McDowall knew that he was not there.
12 Unfortunately neither was his deputy, Angela Scott.
13 She was not there. They had both gone off. So there
14 was no-one at that point, 4.55, actually in the premises
15 and to expect them to get in there quickly would have
16 been perhaps asking too much. So what was needed was
17 an interim control room Silver who performed that role
18 and was appointed to do that. Alan accepted that he
19 really wasn't that person, although he was trying to
20 fulfil it.
21 There were plenty of others, because he is SO12,
22 there were plenty of Silvers available. They had
23 already been identified one way or another by
24 Angela Scott before she left at 2 am. So it's not as
25 though there was a shortage of resources. The
66
1 importance of a central Silver which has an effect on
2 what happened at 9.33 onwards, is that the central
3 Silver does what Alan didn't manage to do.
4 He makes sure not only that the strategy to get to
5 Scotia Road as soon as practicable is carried out, and
6 he also, as it were, makes sure by checking that when
7 you say "please go there" that they have gone there.
8 Now, you might delegate that responsibility in turn to
9 another Silver, like the location Silver. However,
10 there isn't a central Silver. Boutcher doesn't get back
11 to New Scotland Yard until 10 minutes past 7.
12 But, as I say, there were other officers available
13 to perform and see through this policy of
14 implementation. If Alan was the locum Silver, which
15 I suggest and he accepts he really wasn't that, but he
16 was trying to do his best, he would have been at the
17 7 o'clock meeting as the central Silver, but he wasn't.
18 Neither was his superior, Noel Baker, wasn't at the
19 7 o'clock meeting.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, but I mean, I take your point
21 about his rank. He is another inspector, in fact. As
22 far as he was concerned, he thought he had done what
23 (inaudible) ordered.
24 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, but the problem is if he had been
25 properly undertaking his Silver task, he would have
67
1 followed it through, just like McDowall should have
2 followed his strategy through with the central Silver
3 just to check it was being done; the central Silver
4 would have checked with the location Silver to make sure
5 these resources were getting there. So it's a quick
6 pass-down, I think the word being used, police speak, is
7 cascade of authority down, so there would be a cascade
8 of authority in that way.
9 As I say, I am not, as it were, going to get bogged
10 down with what actually happened. What is plain is the
11 strategy didn't reach ZAJ. He didn't know it had
12 switched from overt to covert. Neither did Andrew.
13 Whether they are inaccurate or accurate or whatever --
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It does seem that's where the breakdown
15 in communication took place.
16 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Precisely why is possibly something we
18 will never truly discover.
19 Why is it not, as it were, effectively
20 an independent failure of a delegate to carry out
21 instructions?
22 MR MANSFIELD: It is an independent failure but the failure,
23 the overarching failure is for the person who set the
24 strategy, because his obligation is to ensure that it is
25 implemented by others.
68
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Why can't he assume it's going to be
2 done?
3 MR MANSFIELD: No, that's the one thing even -- I appreciate
4 the ACPO guidance is only guidance, but it's very
5 sensible guidance. He has to update. The word he has
6 got -- he has to update according to intelligence. He
7 has to update himself and, even if he doesn't think of
8 it before 7 o'clock, he obviously would be asking. He
9 meets two tactical advisers. He has not got a note of
10 who they are. He says it's Andrew and in evidence he
11 thinks it's Rush, but we may never know exactly who they
12 were.
13 In any event, even if it doesn't happen at 5.15, by
14 6.40 when he is again meeting people of certain
15 importance in terms of their roles, he would be then
16 just checking: how's it going, have you got there, are
17 you making sure they are there, and has anybody left, is
18 the question everybody I think would want to know. Has
19 anybody left?
20 You might not want to know that if you are on some
21 sort of, as it were, operation dealing with shoplifters.
22 The person on top might not need to know whether they've
23 spotted the usual target, but this is so very different
24 in terms of deploying lethal weaponry, you would want to
25 know whether somebody has left if they are going to pose
69
1 a threat to the whole of London. If I may say so, the
2 police at this time must have been extraordinarily
3 sensitive to the fact that, as far as they were
4 concerned, these were bombings, and attempted bombings,
5 of which they had no prior notice. So they must have
6 been, having got a little prior notice, very concerned
7 to ensure if they could that there wasn't a third
8 explosion that very day by regrouping.
9 So we say it gets bogged down after Alan, but if
10 there had been a central Silver, what would have
11 happened is, plainly, there is an orange team on
12 standby. It's a complete, if I may say so, as it turns
13 out, waste of a resource, because they sit in the
14 canteen and I am not interested in whether they are
15 brought centrally because it's sensible to do so. They
16 were available for deployment at that point, and they,
17 if somebody had just managed to turn their minds to it,
18 it's about co-ordination, it's about management, it's
19 about ensure that what you want done is done.
20 There is the orange team. They have got ZAJ as
21 their tactical adviser. He's also doing work for the
22 24-hour DSO as a Kratos adviser essentially or
23 a tactical adviser then, but he's also the team --
24 a team adviser and the team inspector for the orange
25 team, he's sitting with them in the canteen from about
70
1 5.30 onwards. They are kitted up, they are ready to go.
2 Therefore, if a central Silver had been appointed
3 and recognised because they would have to have made
4 themselves aware, so where are the armed teams? They
5 haven't got an unlimited number. Where are they, and if
6 you don't know yourself, you ask the tac adviser: where
7 is he? ZAJ would have said they are with me downstairs.
8 So by 5.30, in New Scotland Yard, and this is why if
9 you just stand back from New Scotland Yard you think on
10 the different floors it's all there again, they have got
11 a Silver who could have been the central Silver; they
12 have a firearms team that could have been sent out; they
13 have got ZAJ on hand who could have been sent out; they
14 have a location Silver by now, because at 4.57 a message
15 is sent to Rose. In he comes as fast as he can, he is
16 there by 5.30. What does he do?
17 Rather like the orange team, I am not saying he sits
18 around idly but he is left there. Nothing happens until
19 gone 7 when McDowall has a meeting with Purser and Rose,
20 and this is not a question of identifying the Silver for
21 each plot. What happens according to Purser is at the
22 end of the meeting there is an embarrassing moment in
23 which --
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: They sort it out between themselves.
25 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, and he volunteers, I am not sure he is
71
1 too keen to do it for all sorts of reasons but anyway he
2 feels he has to do it so he puts himself forward and
3 it's at that point he is identified. It's all too late.
4 It's coming too late. It's not Purser's fault. I am
5 afraid it goes back to the higher echelons of not really
6 putting this into effect.
7 But Rose was there at 5.30, so it would have been
8 possible to have a central Silver, a location Silver
9 goes out with the orange team. They could have arrived
10 after a briefing with the location Silver at a holding
11 point such as the TA Centre which had been identified in
12 fact by the red team. I am going to be generous. They
13 could have been there by 7 o'clock. As Andrew said, he
14 could have kept them on beyond 8 o'clock if it was
15 necessary to wait for the black team if they were going
16 to take over, for example, and hadn't gone somewhere
17 else. And if it was necessary to bring another team in
18 like the blue team off training, that was possible. The
19 grey team were going to come back on at 10, so there
20 were resources.
21 So in a sense, it didn't have to be a choice between
22 addresses, because the final point here is that the
23 black team, and this is another misapprehension in the
24 Health and Safety trial, and possibly to begin with
25 here, which I include myself in, it was not appreciated
72
1 because the theme at the Health and Safety trial was
2 that: well, they were very tired and we couldn't bring
3 them in. That was the way it was put.
4 It's now perfectly clear that the black team had
5 been resting since midday the day before. So they could
6 have been brought in early and they ought, some of them
7 agreed, Ralph I think was one of them, said could have
8 been brought in an hour earlier, which would have been
9 enough.
10 So if the orange team had already gone to
11 Scotia Road, you get the black team up to Portnall Road
12 if that's the problem, and it would have taken slightly
13 longer, but if they had come in at 6, been briefed at
14 Leman Street, then gone to a holding place near
15 Portnall Road, they would probably have been there --
16 one allows two hours for the briefings and getting there
17 and kitting up -- they could have been to Portnall Road
18 by 8 o'clock.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You are really saying that there were
20 adequate SO19 or CO19 resources there without having to
21 have resource to an ARV or a TST?
22 MR MANSFIELD: Absolutely. Just on that point, all we say
23 about ARVs is, we certainly now know where they were all
24 occupied or should I say preoccupied; in order to get
25 one into the safest window, that overall 6 minute but
73
1 probably half that time, you can't rely on ringing up
2 and finding out, can we have an ARV. They should have
3 been on standby as a last resort being lesser trained
4 and so on, but they didn't even do that.
5 So again we say that the safest opportunity was
6 missed. May I just give you the reference, because it's
7 an important reference. I have not included it in the
8 transcripts but McDowall, in answer to the question
9 I have posed today, whose responsibility for ensuring
10 all this is implemented, he accepted on 25 September in
11 cross-examination, pages 92 to 93, that it was his
12 responsibility.
13 So I do not have to rely on ACPO, vicarious
14 liability or anything. It's nothing to do with that.
15 It's his responsibility, not somebody else's, his
16 responsibility to ensure that this was carried through.
17 We say, I am afraid, he dismally failed to do that. One
18 appreciates all the difficulties but this is the job of
19 a Gold Commander, I fear. He has to do that.
20 So given, again, the time constraints, what I may do
21 is just this: if in relation to these first two stages,
22 to indicate that what I have been putting is not pie in
23 the sky, it isn't some clever academic argument with, as
24 it were, feet off the ground. All of this was traversed
25 with two extremely important witnesses. Can I just give
74
1 you the page numbers in there, rather than -- can I just
2 go to the absolutely appropriate pages.
3 TJ84 starts at page 13. May I just check. These
4 are taken straight off -- the transcript references are
5 in fact included as well. He starts at page 13 of this
6 bundle, but in fact I start asking him questions on
7 page 15 where I say:
8 "Good morning. I want to turn to the scene itself
9 and ask for your help ..."
10 Then on the following pages I go through actually
11 all the points I have been putting this morning about
12 the necessity for reconnaissance; in fact that's covered
13 on page 16:
14 "... needs to have a reconnaissance of the area
15 covertly?
16 "Answer: Right ...", and so forth.
17 In fact, if I may say so, what he does is agree with
18 all the propositions I am putting, including agreeing
19 that it sounds sensible, page 17.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
21 MR MANSFIELD: So hopefully all I have done is to put
22 extraordinarily commonsensical points to him, and you
23 don't need to be a police officer to work them out. He
24 goes all the way through, in fact, to the end, and I'm
25 afraid it's a very long passage and I will not take up
75
1 time reading it, but I would ask you to read those pages
2 because all the points I have just made in argument are
3 set out and he agrees essentially that a stop could have
4 been done if they had been obviously ordered to do one.
5 In fact, it's a question from you, sir, page 28,
6 line 11, where:
7 "Do you think you would have been able to do, carry
8 out" --
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, I remember that. What was the
10 minimum number you needed to do it.
11 MR MANSFIELD: That's right.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I think he said two cars.
13 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
14 It's interesting, his initial answer to you, which
15 we say is absolutely spot on, and if I may say, possibly
16 as far as our submissions are concerned, TJ84 was one of
17 the most impressive witnesses to have appeared at this.
18 There are others, but if I may be allowed to pick him
19 out in the way -- it's not just because he agrees with
20 my propositions.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It's not a bad start.
22 MR MANSFIELD: I think it was -- well, I do not speak just
23 for myself. It was the way in which he gave his
24 evidence as well as what he said that impressed a large
25 number of people.
76
1 But it's his first response to your question:
2 "With these types of stakes ..."
3 In other words he is exactly assessing that because
4 of the risks involved of the public transport, even
5 though it's a tight window, you would have to do it, and
6 he could have done it.
7 So that's TJ84. I am afraid --
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Half the team, he actually said, which
9 would be three cars' worth.
10 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Because he has three officers in each
12 car.
13 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
14 So it could have been done. Then page 30 onwards is
15 the Silver himself, Mr Purser. I did exactly the same
16 exercise in some detail, none of which involved picking
17 out a spot, none of which involved only looking at
18 people foot-borne with cars as well. 32 onwards are the
19 particular pages I would ask you to look at. May I just
20 pick out, on page 33, line 15, the need for a Silver at
21 New Scotland Yard, line 16.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Page?
23 MR MANSFIELD: 33:
24 "... if you are going to deploy [page 33, line 16]
25 to a location like Scotia Road, you are going to need to
77
1 have another Silver, which is of course where you come
2 in [that's Purser] eventually, another Silver and I'm
3 going to call them a location Silver, who's going to
4 take charge of the location; correct?
5 "Answer: Yes, I think they have now re-badged it
6 Bronze ..."
7 Then I avoid the terms and then I go on building the
8 picture of what is necessary to do, and in fact on
9 page 36, just one other example, at line 4 -- it's
10 a rather long question but in fact it leads to what we
11 say is a commonsensical answer:
12 "... please understand, I'll get to what actually
13 happened. This is not leading into some massive
14 critique of yourself, do you understand, I'm really not
15 doing that; I just want to build up a picture through
16 you, because you actually ended up having to go there as
17 it happened rather late in the day.
18 "So, now, it's been suggested every time I do this
19 by others who come after me that this is all hindsight.
20 It's not hindsight, do you follow me? This is all very
21 commonsensical foresight. Somebody has to work out what
22 is the window of opportunity, not because we know he's
23 going to number 2 bus stop on Tulse Hill, because you
24 don't know that. What you don't know is which of the
25 bus stops he may go to, so you need to know, if he is
78
1 going to go to a bus and is on foot, and not in a car,
2 not on a bicycle, all right, on foot; because of what
3 happened the day before, let's find out where the
4 nearest bus stops are. That's pretty commonsensical and
5 reasonable exercise, isn't it?
6 "Answer: I wanted to know where the bus stops were,
7 yes.
8 "Question: You did, thank you very much. That's
9 foresight ...", and so on.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: A question that was perilously
11 trembling on the edge of a speech.
12 MR MANSFIELD: It was. I accept that criticism and I'm
13 sorry it was a rather long one.
14 One thing that I hope can't be said, that nobody has
15 not been aware of the points that I am now putting,
16 because they have been put extensively to witnesses, and
17 the only point eventually I was ending up saying to
18 Mr Purser was he couldn't do any of this because he
19 didn't actually get down there, not his fault, he wasn't
20 appointed and volunteered until 7.15. He then stuck
21 with the firearms team, gave a briefing separately from
22 surveillance and ended up at Nightingale Lane really and
23 leaving rather later in the day and certainly probably
24 not getting to the TA Centre before Jean Charles has got
25 on to the bus.
79
1 So it's a race against time. That's what the
2 problem has become. It's a race against time because
3 the strategy, as set out, had not been put into place.
4 That's why we say it's not too remote, the setting of
5 the strategy, from what actually happened. It is very,
6 as it were, close to what actually happened.
7 May I just move to the next stage, which is the 9.33
8 position in fact in the absence of the orange team and
9 so on and the set-up that should have been in place
10 before.
11 Again, the situation here --
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Stage three, really, I suppose.
13 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, stage three, 9.33. McDowall still has
14 responsibility overall for the implementation of
15 strategy, but Cressida Dick has now an intervening role
16 as the DSO.
17 I am not going to spend a lot of time dealing with
18 the points that have been made about who knew you were
19 and who knew what your role was and so on. I am going
20 to come straight to the kernel of it all. She set in
21 her decision log decision number 3, in fact it's the
22 second document that perhaps I ought just to ask you to
23 look at. It's the one which she ...
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, that's up.
25 MR MANSFIELD: Decision number 3. It's an extremely
80
1 important decision. I am not going to lock her into
2 a particular time, but she says when she writes it up
3 later it's 8 am, so I'll go on that for the moment.
4 Again, there is an appreciation of what should be
5 happening, namely:
6 "Safety of all, seek to arrest any of the subjects,
7 [meaning suspects] near or at the address."
8 I am going to leave out "at"; no-one is suggesting,
9 because of compromise, that actually is right. So I am
10 just concentrating on "near":
11 "Premises made safe possible before the release of
12 photographs."
13 So it's a covert operation. Then there is the
14 important paragraph below after they have dealt with
15 "the risks they pose to Londoners is very considerable",
16 so this is the context again. In capital letters:
17 "We cannot therefore allow them to travel far even
18 under surveillance if sighted, as I cannot guarantee we
19 will not have a surveillance loss which could be
20 catastrophic. However, the decision is to attempt to
21 arrest some distance away should that be possible in
22 order not to alert any person remaining in the address."
23 Then booby traps and so on.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: She talked to McDowall starting from
25 about 7.15.
81
1 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: As I read it, this reflects effectively
3 what she and McDowall agreed at about that time.
4 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: She may have read (inaudible)
6 8 o'clock, I understand that.
7 MR MANSFIELD: That's right.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes. But really she and Mr McDowall
9 re-visited the strategy at this point, it would seem to
10 me.
11 MR MANSFIELD: That's right, and therefore I say, as I have
12 been, that they should not have been revisiting
13 a strategy in a vacuum. What should have been
14 happening, given the demands, given the context, given
15 the threat level, is, well, how are things at
16 Scotia Road? A red team has been there since 6 o'clock.
17 A black team, everybody appreciates, isn't conceivably
18 going to get there by 8 am, and as we know, from the
19 visit -- from the list of people leaving, that in fact
20 people have been starting to leave and are leaving
21 during this period of time. As it happens, not people
22 who could readily be regarded as worth stopping.
23 It would appear, it's only by accident that
24 Commander Dick happens to look up at a screen, this is
25 how it comes about, and notice that people have already
82
1 left. Now, it may be she doesn't need to be alerted
2 about people that don't matter, and I am not going to
3 take up time but it does appear an extraordinary way to
4 go about things. However, people have already started
5 leaving. You might think that that would prompt
6 a question in somebody's mind: supposing they had been
7 a bomber, do we have anybody down there to stop them?
8 Again, is this hindsight or is this just simple,
9 straightforward planning of a high risk situation facing
10 London, which hopefully any senior Commander would
11 recognise is important? We suggest that in fact
12 Commander Dick has become obsessed with bureaucracy at
13 New Scotland Yard rather than what is going on on the
14 ground. Therefore not allowing them to run is all very
15 well, provided you have got the resources in place to do
16 that, and it cannot be said ARVs are going to fulfil
17 that role.
18 We get, therefore, into the frame, as it were, this
19 period, if I can -- so I can relate it to what we say
20 are specific charges as well as the narrative. There is
21 another individual who we say has a responsibility here
22 for a duty that is owed and that is the senior tactical
23 adviser in New Scotland Yard. Because he has come on at
24 6 o'clock, that's Mr Esposito. If anybody should know
25 the disposition of firearms teams, it's him.
83
1 If anybody -- to give advice, I accept he is not
2 responsible for the decisions, but he is responsible for
3 providing the person who does take the decisions with
4 reliable information such that it is a decision that is
5 not negligently taken. So he must be in a position,
6 after 6 o'clock, and after 7 o'clock because he attends
7 the 7 o'clock meeting, he must be asking the question,
8 these are questions that have been put to him, well,
9 where are the firearms? Everybody seems to be relaxed,
10 oh well they are en route, they are on way.
11 This is not the Health and Safety question, so if
12 I may say again, this is a distinction from the Health
13 and Safety trial, this is not the Health and Safety
14 question; the question here, never mind the risk to the
15 public, what about the risk to an innocent individual in
16 this limited category, if you are not in position to do
17 a safe stop in the safest place as I have already
18 delineated.
19 In fact when I asked Esposito about this very
20 decision that's on the screen at the moment,
21 October 14th, page 210, I have not copied this one, but
22 when I asked him whether he was aware, even, of this
23 strategy at or near the premises, he said he was
24 unaware. Again, extraordinary that he was unaware.
25 Even if Cressida Dick didn't tell him, you would think
84
1 he would want to know what the strategy was, otherwise
2 how's he going to give advice.
3 So he isn't even aware of this strategy, he says.
4 And he goes on to say, on October 14th, page 166, that
5 he can't remember it even crossing his mind when I was
6 asking him, did you even know where the bus stops were.
7 Again, is this asking too much of the people determining
8 strategy that if you are going to do the safest stop,
9 and he is the one advising the Commander who's going to
10 decide on an interception, he has to be able to say to
11 her it's possible or it's not possible, not the precise
12 tree under which it's going to happen, but he can say --
13 he could have said and he didn't say, that it's
14 impossible.
15 He has to be giving accurate advice about that, and
16 what he should have been saying is, if we are going to
17 do a safe stop and we are going to do it at the safest
18 place, we have to have the resources prepared to do it
19 because any one of these people who are now coming out
20 from 8 o'clock onwards could be a potential bomber.
21 But no, nothing like that. There is no sense of
22 urgency about any of this. And that has been reflected
23 by the CO19 officers, the black team in particular, who
24 have been asked by Mr Hilliard and Mr Hough repeatedly,
25 was there any sense of urgency communicated? No.
85
1 I doubt they could have acted much more quickly, but
2 there was no sense of urgency being communicated here at
3 all, because they had all relaxed into the frame of mind
4 -- one of the frame of minds was this, I submit, and we
5 have put it in our written submissions, but I just
6 reflect on it for a moment, that actually what was
7 affecting subconsciously the whole decision-making
8 process was the footprint approach.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You mean the thought that there was not
10 going to be anybody there anyway?
11 MR MANSFIELD: That's right. Dick said that very clearly at
12 the trial, and I asked her about what she said; very
13 clearly at the trial asked by Mr Thwaites on behalf of
14 the Commissioner, called on behalf of the Office of the
15 Commissioner, she said very clearly that that really
16 wasn't, I will be generous to her, it really wasn't a
17 high possibility. It was a possibility but it certainly
18 wasn't a high possibility.
19 So they were relaxing, and then there was this other
20 train of thought: oh well, this time they will do it
21 later in the day to have maximum effect. These are
22 extraordinary assumptions that the command team
23 effectively were taking, and we suggest it's beginning
24 to influence the fact there's no sense of urgency. Oh
25 well, the black team are en route, that will do. We say
86
1 they just got there and if somebody had been on the
2 ball, which they weren't, then they could have been sent
3 into action. It's not the fault of the black team at
4 all.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I understand what you are saying. If
6 you like, the mindset that all this was actually going
7 to turn out to be a waste of time because there was
8 nobody there anyway, doesn't actually seem to have
9 figured in any of the memoranda that came into
10 existence, starting from 4.55 onwards, 6.50 over to
11 7.15, or any of the strategy documents that we have
12 seen. It doesn't appear anywhere.
13 MR MANSFIELD: No, and it's of interest that it doesn't
14 because we say it's a psychological factor which they
15 might not want to write down, but it has certainly come
16 out in the evidence they have said that.
17 McDowall in relation to it will happen later in the
18 day was the thinking of Boutcher as well, and in Dick's
19 case, just didn't think there would be -- the way it was
20 put at the trial was: did you expect, words to this
21 expect, a bomber or potential suicide bomber with
22 a rucksack would come out of the front door of
23 Scotia Road, and she was saying effectively she was not
24 expecting that.
25 That's only one small brick in the wall of what was
87
1 going on, but it builds for each individual, because
2 I appreciate I can't aggregate all of this and put it at
3 the door of one person, I'm trying to deal with the
4 individuals concerned. You can incrementally see in
5 an individual's case what has been going, we say,
6 seriously wrong in relation to what we say is a duty
7 that they had here.
8 This cannot be better illustrated than by what
9 happened at 9.33. If one needs any clearer indicator
10 that the reason things weren't pulled together is
11 because the command team actually ... I think the phrase
12 that was used -- I mean I used it but I wasn't the first
13 one to use it -- in the Divisional Court, where
14 different issues were at stake: they were in charge but
15 not in control. That was a phrase used, in fact,
16 I think in the first place by Mr Doherty, but I employed
17 it in the Divisional Court because it aptly described
18 what then happened.
19 At 9.33, because that's the time in the log, that's
20 the agreed time he leaves, Pat notices someone leaving
21 in the sense that he gets the message one way or
22 another, because it seems the way it works is that Frank
23 can't use the Cougar, another of the failings but I am
24 not putting that down to Dick or any of the others. He
25 has to go over the Airwave but another officer puts it
88
1 out over the Cougar. So within a fairly short space of
2 time, Pat is aware in the central location that somebody
3 of interest has left. It may not be higher than that.
4 We say at that point, given the stakes, as TJ84 put
5 it, in this case, given the level of threat, is this
6 unreasonable to suppose that Cressida Dick should have
7 been on the ball? Yes, one appreciates there is so much
8 going on, but --
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, should have been told.
10 MR MANSFIELD: I am coming to that. We say was told but
11 didn't register. Effectively I'm not going to go
12 through, if one actually, I think I put it in an earlier
13 hearing there were more chiefs than Indians. Just look
14 at that control room. How many senior officers were in
15 there? Boutcher, Scott, you have co-ordinators,
16 managers, plenty of people. Perhaps too many cooks
17 spoiling the broth on this occasion. Just too many
18 people. I have not put noise other than in the
19 narrative.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Pat says he waved his arms to attract
21 her attention. She says, "I didn't appreciate anybody
22 had come out until he was already on the bus". That's
23 the gap.
24 MR MANSFIELD: That's the gap, yes, and it's a very
25 important gap because you can't afford to have that gap
89
1 if you have already identified that they can't run and
2 you have only got, because you can work it out,
3 a six-minute, five-minute, four-minute gap of walking,
4 even less if they are in a car. What was Cressida Dick
5 going to do about that, if they got in a car? "I didn't
6 notice that, I didn't know until they got to
7 Trafalgar Square"?
8 I am sorry, it won't do. It is gross omission not
9 to be absolutely alive, she is in that room, standing
10 with a group of officers, and Pat's account of
11 attracting attention by waving, he says because of the
12 noise but it doesn't really matter, attracting attention
13 at 9.33, and that is supported by, I think it's Brian,
14 who is sitting two rows behind or a row behind. He
15 confirms that he sees exactly the same. So she is
16 actually notified.
17 What about Esposito? Very interesting what he says.
18 He says in his statement that was put to him,
19 October 14th, page 69:
20 "Yes, I did know, 9.34.
21 "Question: Oh, well, did you tell Cressida Dick?
22 "Answer: I thought she was aware."
23 Again, this won't do from the two top people. I say
24 Esposito is the top person because he has the
25 responsibility of advising her very, very quickly
90
1 whether this should be an intervention, and we are
2 submitting there should have been a safe intervention,
3 stop, of anyone who had not been excluded. Anyone who
4 could not be discounted should have been stopped safely
5 and in a controlled fashion without compromising the
6 address.
7 So Esposito and Dick are just not really focusing.
8 Esposito says: oh, well, I am on the phone. Again, we
9 have this remarkable situation whereby, I am not going
10 into communications under this heading but it's in the
11 narrative, is totally ludicrous. They are having to use
12 mobiles so they can't get through if somebody is
13 engaged. They are not listening to the surveillance
14 chatter that should have been, we say, put up at
15 an audible level so that what -- is this so outrageous
16 that what Cressida Dick at that time, there is nothing
17 at 9.33 going on at Portnall Road. This is the highest
18 priority. Somebody has come out of interest. For that
19 next half an hour she should have been riveted to what
20 was going on, riveted. No, in the middle of all this,
21 probably at Brixton, that's where Jean Charles has got
22 to, she's briefing a loggist who has not turned up,
23 Mr Cremin, almost precisely at the time he is getting on
24 and off buses.
25 So the earliest -- she actually is not able to say
91
1 when she first learnt. It certainly wasn't at 9.33. It
2 certainly wasn't until he got on the bus, and we say it
3 certainly wasn't until later than that even. In her
4 taped record that she made after these events, she had
5 put down a time which I put to her, it's in the tape.
6 She says 9.45. Hopeless. Hopeless situation. She is
7 not aware until after or about 9.45 about what is going
8 on in relation to this individual.
9 That leaves her, as it turns out, and nobody could
10 predict it, it could have been even less. It leaves her
11 with 15 minutes maximum to decide what to do, and it
12 should not have been like that, and it need not have
13 been like that, if both these two, Commander Dick and
14 Esposito, had really been focusing on the job in hand
15 that they had to do.
16 I do not go through what -- then vacillated in
17 between. We know at 9.48, I just mention it, is the
18 Dingemans call, and we have a situation in which it is
19 thought, possibly through malcommunication, one knows
20 not, that it's not Nettle Tip, and Dingemans, this is
21 the most remarkable part, if I may put it. It's not
22 causative. It's illustrative of a lack of real focus
23 here, of real proper communication and ensuring that
24 there was proper communication of getting, as it were,
25 the words from the horse's mouth rather than through
92
1 somebody else, through somebody else, whether it's
2 Silver or TJ84.
3 The fact is that at 9.48, Dingemans with blues and
4 twos races along this other route up to Stockwell, turns
5 right, sees the bus. If he had been a bomber, Dick and
6 her order effectively for SO12 to follow, or certainly
7 allowing that to happen, because she may not have known
8 that it had already happened by the time she knew about
9 it, would have compromised the whole situation. The
10 bomber would have seen the blues and twos coming round,
11 turning round behind the bus. Again, it's not quite
12 keystone level but we are getting close to it, with them
13 coming up behind.
14 May I pass through to the next stage.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Before you do that, can you remind me
16 what time was Dingemans detailed off? 9.48?
17 MR MANSFIELD: 9.59.
18 MR HORWELL: 9.55. It's 48 to 55 are the two times.
19 MR MANSFIELD: Sorry, my mistake.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: There are some corrections for Lambeth
21 time, but subject to that, it's somewhere around 9.55.
22 MR MANSFIELD: Yes. So 48 to 55. Which, just in passing,
23 had there been motorcycles, would have been an even
24 faster time, but there we are. He manages to get there
25 in that time using that route.
93
1 Passing to two minutes past 10, so it's seven
2 minutes later, again in relation to the duty owed by
3 both Esposito, we say, and Commander Dick at this point,
4 firstly by two minutes past 10 we have this
5 extraordinary identification position because that's,
6 it's all hinging effectively on the Frank, "he's worth
7 another look", a fleeting glance by James.
8 One has to stand back at this point because we say
9 they have allowed it to get into a situation now,
10 because they have missed the main opportunity, and I am
11 not suggesting anything should have happened on the bus.
12 I am not suggesting anything should have happened at
13 Brixton in the crowds. Although there may be techniques
14 that are developed, it may have been just too difficult.
15 He is off the bus for a minute or so.
16 But once we are getting to Stockwell, they have
17 a remarkable opportunity which they might not have had
18 in the normal fast-moving situation. They had somebody
19 on the bus. They had somebody on the bus almost waving
20 a flag, look he is getting off now, so they knew
21 perfectly well he was getting off. They did get that
22 message.
23 If one thinks about it, the time between knowing
24 that he's about to get off, and I'm sorry, this is where
25 I got the time from, the time when they were aware that
94
1 he was getting off was 9.59, I had mixed the times up.
2 9.59 is when they knew he was getting off. That's
3 Lawrence on the bus.
4 If one thinks about it, there is another window of
5 opportunity. They are not going to get very common
6 opportunities the closer one gets to central London, and
7 maybe this is the best it's going to get, and it's no
8 use saying, "These are battle conditions, you can't
9 expect decent decisions", or, "You can't expect an
10 unreasonable duty of care". I'm not asking for
11 unreasonable duty of care. I'm asking for a reasonable
12 duty of care that once you know he is getting off at
13 Stockwell, of course he might not be going to the tube,
14 he might be going to one of the other addresses,
15 Blair House, he might be walking, but you have to, if
16 I can put it in the colloquial, you are going to have to
17 do a hit right there before he moves too far away from
18 the bus stop.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Pausing there a moment, if he turned
20 the other way so as to go to Blair House, which is just
21 up the road, in one sense the urgency decreases, because
22 he is not going to detonate a bomb if he is going to one
23 of his own bases.
24 MR MANSFIELD: True.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Indeed, it may be an absolutely golden
95
1 intelligence opportunity, they don't know. The crisis
2 begins to develop when it is realised that he is heading
3 for the tube.
4 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, which is the 10.02 time.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, that's right.
6 MR MANSFIELD: One, they know he's getting off the bus. May
7 I pause at the time when he is getting off the bus
8 because this is a factor we say bears very strongly on
9 the decisions that had to be taken, and they must have,
10 including Esposito, known this.
11 The identification position was extraordinarily
12 tenuous. Although the stakes are very high, they are
13 very high both ways. In other words the risk of
14 stopping the wrong person in dangerous circumstances and
15 death becomes that much higher at this point. Because
16 I have tried to put Dick's evidence together on this.
17 It appears that, because she says something different in
18 the log from what she says in a note, it appears that
19 this is what's happened. She was aware that to begin
20 with for a brief time he was a possible, then he wasn't
21 Nettle Tip, then he became a possible again, and then he
22 became pretty sure. That's the sequence. That's all
23 within roughly the 15 minutes of her awareness that she
24 has had from 9.45 onwards.
25 You have to set that against a background at which
96
1 this was quite unlike another operation where they have
2 had a lifestyle exercise, they follow the person, they
3 know it's the same person, they know the name, they know
4 the background. They knew none of that in this case.
5 They just had not properly appreciated in the first
6 place by the command team a very poor image of the
7 person, that's the surveillance team evidence, almost to
8 a man. Very poor image was being compared with
9 a fleeting glance and a vacillation that goes from
10 "certainly not" to "certainly is". In other words if
11 they had waited another five minutes another officer
12 might have said, "That's not my view", probably Lawrence
13 because he is coming off the bus. Whereas of course you
14 have Ken on foot ahead and Ivor for that matter but Ken
15 saying "possibly is".
16 Now, in that situation where you have, it's merely
17 background but it's informative background, where you
18 have a situation where actually you can't really say
19 whether he is or he isn't; that should inform what you
20 are going to do given the timeframe that if he is
21 heading to the station, then you have got to act quickly
22 in at least the safest conditions you can have, in those
23 circumstances.
24 So the next stage at which there is a safe
25 opportunity again missed is Binfield Road. Now, in the
97
1 clip of transcripts, again I do not read it out, Ralph
2 was asked by me about a safe stop. That's page 6
3 onwards. He is the team leader of black, he was in one
4 of the vehicles queuing up, not the lead vehicle, the
5 third one.
6 If I may just go to the passage that perhaps is most
7 important. He is asked questions by Mr Hough in
8 re-examination, if I can call it that, on page 11,
9 because I have been careful not to trespass upon exactly
10 what tactics, because what he is saying is: we could
11 have done it above ground. And when asked by Mr Hough,
12 at page 11 onwards, exactly how would it have been done,
13 he says, and you asked "middle of what road", and he
14 says on page 12, Binfield Road. He describes how he
15 would have done it: "in the street, with a bit of
16 distance for firearms officer, so a bit of safety for
17 them".
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Sorry, which page is this?
19 MR MANSFIELD: It should be page 12.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Sorry, I was looking at page 11.
21 MR MANSFIELD: It starts on page 11. There is a long answer
22 in answer to yourself about how he would have done it,
23 minimising the risks. We say he was not the only one
24 sitting at the lights. I say sitting at the lights,
25 they are approaching the lights, they have had a race to
98
1 get there but they have got there. But more importantly
2 than even him being there and then eventually ordering
3 state red at a time which is, we say, too late, he is
4 down the escalators, and somebody who it cannot be
5 reliably said is him, and leaving out what firearms
6 officers thought they heard, just dealing with the
7 command team's responsibility here, in fact the position
8 was that the Alpha car was two cars ahead. We have seen
9 the Mercedes pulling out on the compilation, and plainly
10 if state red had been called, at least officers which
11 included C2 in the Alpha car could have got out of that
12 car and been across to the entrance of the tube station
13 at the very least to perform an interception.
14 But there is an even better candidate, as we now all
15 know. Another difference with the Health and Safety
16 trial is in fact the understanding that is now much,
17 much clearer as a result of officers who were not called
18 in the Health and Safety trial that C12 had used
19 a different route and he had already reached, and we
20 have put his evidence in the clip as well on this, C12
21 we have put, it's the first part of the clip, there are
22 a number of reasons why he is there, but page 3.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Hang on one minute.
24 MR MANSFIELD: Page 3 of the clip. (Pause). This is C12,
25 page 3. He has arrived -- I am going to call it the
99
1 hatching, you may remember the hatching on the
2 photograph.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, I remember. Yes.
4 MR MANSFIELD: "So we were at this stage" -- he is moving
5 slowly, that's what he is describing, he is moving
6 slowly towards it because he realises where Stockwell
7 station is, he realises it's an area of threat or could
8 be, and therefore he is preparing himself.
9 He says at line 11:
10 "So we were at this stage, certainly when the
11 suspect had entered the tube, very, very close to the
12 tube ... I remember there being a radio silence and
13 I was very frustrated by this.
14 "Question: Did you hear this: 'towards platforms 1
15 and 2'?
16 "Answer: Yes, I did.
17 "Question: As you understood it, who was that
18 talking about?
19 "Answer: The identified suspect, who I believed at
20 that time was a failed suicide bomber.
21 "Question: Yes?
22 "Answer: Again, if I can add that my sense of
23 frustration at this point was great, to say the least.
24 I couldn't understand, if we were at state amber, why we
25 weren't given state red at this time."
100
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: By that time he was down the
2 escalators.
3 MR MANSFIELD: By the time of state red being called, he
4 was.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: No, by the time this sense of
6 frustration ...
7 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, yes.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: He had heard "platforms 1 to 2", ergo
9 he must be down the escalators.
10 MR MANSFIELD: That's right.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: So we are looking actually at
12 a slightly earlier time than this where Charlie 12 and
13 his Mercedes were -- no, not the Mercedes -- they were
14 the last car -- was within 100 yards anyway.
15 MR MANSFIELD: 100 metres, he said he approaches slowly. So
16 during the time he is approaching slowly, the man is
17 getting off the bus and walking, so he has not actually
18 quite got there but he is moving slowly.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It isn't quite as neat a coordination
20 as you are putting here.
21 MR MANSFIELD: No, no.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Looking at the transcript, because by
23 the time they actually get to their hatch marks and
24 stop, then he is getting frustrated, so it's a little
25 bit before that, that's all.
101
1 MR MANSFIELD: That's true, I accept that. In fact it bears
2 on a point that arises out of what he says here. He
3 thought he was at state amber. In fact another problem
4 here, back to Esposito, back to Dick, back to ensuring
5 that Silver, Mr Purser, actually got state amber issued,
6 it never was.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Some officers interpreted, those who
8 heard it, interpreted it as coming from CO19 moving
9 through.
10 MR MANSFIELD: Well, that's this officer thought that.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
12 MR MANSFIELD: But in fact of course it had not been
13 ordered. What should have happened, again it's not
14 hindsight, is the moment that TJ84 -- which is much
15 earlier -- is basically instructed to do the follow and
16 perhaps even if to be generous not at that precise
17 moment but certainly at the moment at which it is being
18 said one way or another that CO19 then believe that
19 either it's a possible or they are following somebody,
20 they may have to intervene on, so some time after
21 Brixton, if not before, they should have been on state
22 amber. Not so they are right behind the bus because
23 that might compromise the surveillance but so they are
24 much closer, in a position so that when he's off the bus
25 before he enters the tube station they can do
102
1 a Binfield Road type stop, and obviously if he walks
2 further north as you say there is a bigger opportunity.
3 The problem was again, it's the race against time
4 because the initial best opportunity has been dismally
5 missed.
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I follow that entirely. I am just
7 questioning a little bit your proposition there. Get
8 behind the bus or get behind the follow.
9 MR MANSFIELD: Follow, yes.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Which is the first order, that's their
11 first deployment, really. State amber I was told or the
12 jury were told is the order that is effectively saying:
13 you have got to get yourselves into position so that
14 when state red is ordered you can immediately deploy.
15 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: So it's the moving through the
17 following surveillance teams and getting up as close as
18 you can to the subject of a follow is the effect of
19 state amber.
20 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's really why I was saying to you
22 a moment ago it's the "get up there" and "C19 units
23 moving through" is the indication that the equivalent of
24 state amber has been ordered.
25 MR MANSFIELD: Only one officer interpreted it that way.
103
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's true.
2 MR MANSFIELD: That's this one, in fact, this particular
3 officer.
4 So that this possible opportunity, because we can
5 only deal with things obviously, and we say they are
6 predictable situations --
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: But what he needed was state red.
8 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, he needed state red, and it should have
9 been called as he was 100 metres away. It should have
10 been called then. Now he might not have been able to --
11 he in fact did get out of the car before it was ordered
12 because --
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: He never heard state red.
14 MR MANSFIELD: He never heard it. In a sense that's saying
15 how bad it gets, but that's what's happened here because
16 again the command team, basically Dick and Esposito are
17 really not in control, and one of the reasons they are
18 not in control is they haven't got the necessary
19 information, why haven't they got the necessary
20 information, and I can put the point shortly, that is
21 TJ80, Esposito, had really not got a clear picture of
22 where everybody was.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Of where they were.
24 MR MANSFIELD: The idea that he says maps don't make any
25 difference, I do not need to know where they are, is
104
1 such grandiose arrogance by somebody in a central
2 control room when you would think they would absolutely
3 -- perhaps he doesn't need to know exactly where
4 everybody is sitting in every car, but he certainly
5 needs to know, and I would submit they do need to know,
6 where the individual units of a team are. It's no use
7 knowing, especially if they get split up and relying on,
8 as it were, second-hand information and certainly
9 relying on a situation in which I do not need to know,
10 and you will have heard the interchanges about where are
11 you and so on.
12 TJ84 said in his evidence very clearly he did keep
13 Esposito informed with landmarks on a map that he, TJ84,
14 was using. Why they have not bothered in the control
15 room to work out this out I don't know, but they
16 obviously were not working on that basis.
17 And the interchange that is supposed to have taken
18 place, particularly, "We can do it, we can do it", no
19 single firearms officer ever claimed that they were
20 saying that, "We can do it, we can do it". So there is
21 something seriously amiss in relation to knowing where
22 your resources are. You have to know where they are in
23 order to take the decision.
24 So therefore state red should have been called much
25 earlier, leaving out amber for the moment, state red
105
1 should have been called much earlier. It's not a margin
2 of error, it's not just a minor judgmental indiscretion
3 when you are dealing with innocent members of the public
4 or, for that matter, potential suicide bombers. These
5 decisions have to be taken fast and carefully at the
6 same time. That's the training.
7 Now, TJ84, in fact he was the one, during the
8 cross-examination at --
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: No firearms officer has told us that he
10 called out, "We can do it, we can do it". There is
11 evidence that people were heard saying that, and indeed
12 as far as Charlie 12 was concerned, that was his state
13 of mind, "We can do it", and Charlie 2 for that matter.
14 MR MANSFIELD: Yes. That's why he got out of the car before
15 state red. He could do it.
16 So that so far as TJ84 is concerned, he had some, if
17 I may say so, other interesting observations. What he
18 was really saying was we don't have a DSO in order to
19 have to take the responsibility ourselves; we thought
20 the DSO would take the responsibility. That's how he
21 introduced what he was going on to say. What he was
22 really saying was it was outrageous, that's the word he
23 used, "the position we were placed in at Stockwell". He
24 didn't place them there. Who placed them there? The
25 command team put them in a outrageous situation that
106
1 they were having to race from behind the starting line
2 in order to catch up when it was already too late.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Forgive me, what do you say he was
4 referring to?
5 MR MANSFIELD: The position that they were in --
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Forgive me, it's the outrageousness of
7 it. Do you follow? It's a strong word. I am bound to
8 say that my impression was that what he was really
9 talking about was that his officers were likely to be
10 put in mortal danger because of the way they were having
11 to approach.
12 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, absolutely, yes, it is that, and to be
13 expected to carry out, in a situation where -- these are
14 the other factors which the command team must have known
15 and did know, they were going to enter and he didn't
16 know, nobody seems to know what the left and right hand
17 are doing, very few of them, certainly the firearms team
18 that I asked knew about the Dingemans situation, very
19 few of them knew about that. Even fewer of them knew
20 exactly where the surveillance team was, which I'm
21 coming to in a moment.
22 So to send them down into the Underground with no
23 communications where there can be no control in fact
24 exercised by the command team and we say the whole point
25 of the DSO is going to be lost. So they have to
107
1 exercise, whether or not they like it, and I'm sorry
2 about the exigencies into which they are placed, but I'm
3 afraid that is the job they have undertaken to do and
4 Cressida Dick particularly came on duty fresh, early,
5 read through her regulations and manuals and so on. So
6 she's not complaining that she is too tired. She is not
7 complaining that it was all too difficult or she was
8 panic stricken.
9 Quite the reverse. So if it is quite the reverse,
10 I'm sorry to say that this situation is completely out
11 of control at this point because having got
12 an extraordinarily tenuous identification procedure
13 which everybody accepts you can't expect, Ivor was
14 saying which I am just coming to now, we could have gone
15 on for another day with this image that we had, we would
16 never have been able to confirm an identification on the
17 back of that, we would have had to have it from another
18 way, another source, cash machine, possibly a mobile
19 phone, something else would have to have been able to
20 confirm, not this photograph.
21 So we have a situation here at this critical moment
22 with gross indecision taking place, the decision is: oh,
23 CO19 to do it when they don't really know where they
24 are. They then learn actually erroneously that they are
25 not in a position to do it.
108
1 Then SO12, if I may come to Ivor, makes an offer.
2 Because Ivor very sensibly has taken the view that in
3 surveillance it's useful to get ahead of the subject,
4 which is, if you think about it, a very commonsensical
5 they think to do. Because if somebody is alive to the
6 fact they are going to be followed, they are not
7 necessarily going to be looking for someone ahead of
8 them. So he is ahead of this individual. He is waiting
9 by the chemist door just inside the concourse and sees
10 Jean Charles come in. Now, the command team don't have
11 the luxury of shall we, shan't we, shall we, shan't we,
12 they have to take a decision. He is offering to do it.
13 We say, given the paucity of identification and the
14 lack of other intelligence, in fact none, that relates
15 to Osman particularly, although there was in relation to
16 Omar, not in relation to this individual, that the
17 proper decision was the one that was actually
18 recommended by Boutcher. He gave evidence in which he
19 said "I weighed up" -- here is somebody who is able to
20 do the weighing up, despite the battle conditions, was
21 it proportionate to use SO12 who were not so highly
22 trained? Answer: yes. We say yes. What does
23 Cressida Dick do? Well, yes then. So she says she
24 orders SO12 to do it and others say they hear her saying
25 that. But it doesn't seem to get communicated to anyone
109
1 on the ground. Again another difficulty. In one sense
2 it would have been a happier result but in fact it
3 didn't get communicated. So SO12, that is Ivor, loses
4 the really best opportunity at this end of the journey.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: He was told to wait.
6 MR MANSFIELD: He was told to wait. We say can't afford to
7 wait. He who hesitates is lost. It's a pretty easy
8 thing to say. I am not in that situation, I don't want
9 to be unrealistic, I don't want to put an unreasonable
10 burden on the shoulders of those who have to take very
11 difficult decisions, but one of the things you are,
12 I hope, taught in conditions like this, you cannot
13 afford, with weapons of destruction at your disposal, to
14 hesitate in this way.
15 So what happens is, according to James, he waits for
16 a minute and a half. 1 minute 26 seconds, when you have
17 only got a timeframe of maybe a couple of minutes. This
18 is ridiculous. Ivor should have been given the advised
19 instruction, "do it", and we now know that in fact there
20 is a very straightforward, conventional method of
21 approach and restraint. It is so commonsensical, it's
22 even more so than any of the propositions relating to
23 Scotia Road.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I think Neil has doubts about it.
25 MR MANSFIELD: Short of just letting them go or shooting
110
1 them --
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: If you are going to put him down to the
3 ground, you have to do it very gently.
4 MR MANSFIELD: That may well be, and one appreciates that it
5 has to be done, but Ivor had a very clear view of how he
6 would do it, and of course you don't go up, sort of say,
7 "Can I take your left arm, can I take your right arm,
8 would you mind holding them out". If one thinks about
9 it, one doesn't have to think too hard and too long to
10 work this out, even from boyhood scout days, you go up
11 covertly behind somebody -- don't worry, I haven't been
12 practising this at home -- you take one arm each, as he
13 described he would. While he was preoccupied -- he had
14 thought it through -- while he was preoccupied, in one
15 hand he has his Oyster card and in the other hand he has
16 his Metro, he is not carrying a rucksack, arms out, you
17 don't put him on the ground because that will be the end
18 of all of them if he is. It's an unarmed stop.
19 What we also go on to say, this is policy so I do
20 not include it, but it's just as a matter of reference,
21 that does involve tactics. I hope I have this right.
22 It appears that CO19, maybe they are now but at that
23 time were not practised in the art of a conventional,
24 almost unarmed stop.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Are you thinking about the evidence of
111
1 the six of the nine strategies?
2 MR MANSFIELD: Yes. It's in parentheses. It's not in the
3 tactical options document. If you remember, I wanted to
4 know what tactics had been developed by CO19. I think
5 the eventual answer that came back from one of the
6 recent witnesses was that this tactic that we were
7 suggesting, namely covert from behind is not something
8 at that time that was being developed.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: But do you question, leaving aside
10 delay and indecision, do you challenge the proposition
11 that other things being equal if you like, the
12 preference should be to use the most highly trained
13 officers, namely CO19?
14 MR MANSFIELD: Well, if they are there to do it, yes.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, I say leaving all else on one
16 side, that they would be the first choice?
17 MR MANSFIELD: Well, it depends where it's happening. They
18 would be the first choice outside the tube station.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Don't make it unnecessarily
20 complicated. All I am really saying is as between CO19
21 and SO12, other things being equal, SO19 are the people
22 to use. Forget about whether it was properly handled or
23 badly handled. It's only that, given when Cressida Dick
24 was given a choice, her first choice subject to what she
25 was being told by everybody's availability, would be,
112
1 one would expect to be, CO19.
2 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, and she was saying, although I am coming
3 to what the decision log says, she was anticipating that
4 that would be happening above ground.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, of course. It's only the
6 respective qualifications I am getting at.
7 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, on that basis alone obviously SO19, but
8 there are circumstances where, and we say obviously once
9 the escalator comes into play, it's not SO19. So yes,
10 you are absolutely right, as a general principle.
11 So that we are now in a situation whereby Ivor has
12 been denied the opportunity to allow this man to stay
13 alive, effectively, and a stop which he had worked out
14 in some detail and was able to describe, and that's why
15 we have -- the Ivor transcript is, so you may note where
16 it is, page 40 onwards, and his description is at a page
17 after 40.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Is this Ivor?
19 MR MANSFIELD: Yes. Ivor. I think it's 52, 52 onwards is
20 where he describes -- and he described it here so
21 graphically I probably don't need to read out exactly
22 how he put it. He was the one who also described being
23 frustrated, he used exactly the same word, because he
24 was not getting any answer, and the Health and Safety
25 trial, he had been uncomfortable about the whole
113
1 situation, that is described on page 43. This is Ivor.
2 Page 43. I am going back to the description:
3 "... when answering questions from Mr Thwaites [who
4 was defending the Office of the Commissioner], as you
5 feeling frustrated and uncomfortable with the situation
6 you were in."
7 So that's two officers, different units.
8 "This is dealing with the situation you were in at
9 Stockwell tube station, isn't it?
10 "Answer: Yes, sir.
11 "Question: I am going to go slowly because of what
12 you have contained in these answers?
13 "Answer: Indeed.
14 "Question: ... 'can you just explain to the jury
15 why you were frustrated? ... In view of the nature of
16 the operation we were deployed upon, and the nature of
17 the attacks...'"
18 Same point as TJ84, the stakes were high:
19 "'... the previous day, I felt that it was prudent
20 to detain the man prior to entering the tube station.'"
21 Then he goes on to go back over the ground we have
22 covered. Again we say everybody on the ground has the
23 picture. The persons who haven't got the picture and
24 should have got the picture and should have taken the
25 decisions, I am afraid, were the command team.
114
1 One comes -- I see the time, may I just do this
2 briefly. I am going to stick to the time because
3 I appreciate others have things to say.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, please, Mr Mansfield.
5 MR MANSFIELD: May I just say one thing, that what I do not
6 finish and there isn't going to be much, if I can commit
7 it to paper so that others are not compromised.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I hope we may just have an hour or so
9 tomorrow afternoon. What I do want from you, as indeed
10 I want from everybody else, is now we have been through
11 it, you have had a chance to consider it, is your
12 proposals as to what questions should be left for the
13 purposes of a narrative verdict.
14 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You have been going through it, through
16 most of this submission. I would just like to have them
17 set out.
18 MR MANSFIELD: They are set out in our document.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: All right. Let me see if I have this
20 other thing right. I have been keeping score of the
21 number of aspects of the evidence which were not
22 available to the Divisional Court in Da Silva and of
23 course therefore were not available to the Health and
24 Safety trial either, and I think I have really got
25 three. The first was that it was not appreciated then
115
1 that there were probably two cars at least at
2 Tulse Hill, Upper Tulse Hill, by the time de Menezes
3 walked past.
4 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Secondly that the black team was
6 available to be called in earlier if anybody had wanted
7 it.
8 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: And the third one is that Charlie 12
10 was already at the station while Mr de Menezes, or
11 approaching the station at any rate, by a different
12 route when Mr de Menezes was walking from the bus.
13 MR MANSFIELD: Yes.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Right?
15 MR MANSFIELD: So far, yes.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you. Now, please continue. We
17 have still got a bit longer. You can have another ten
18 minutes. We started a bit late.
19 MR MANSFIELD: The position here again relates to
20 Cressida Dick's decision log because it's the one, the
21 decision which we say completely demonstrates the fact
22 that the decision which she took to send in SO19 was
23 entirely misconceived. It's decision 18, please.
24 Because what has happened is CO19 to do it, then SO12 to
25 do it, then a countermand to SO12. None of that gets
116
1 through. Ivor continues on his way thinking he is on
2 a surveillance operation. Then she says:
3 "CO19 to arrest."
4 I leave out whether the time is accurate that she
5 has put, 10.05.
6 "If possible in Underground station before enters
7 tube train".
8 Of course the reason:
9 "Am informed CO19 are up with SO12, subject has gone
10 down the escalator".
11 There is overwhelming evidence we say from other
12 sources that she knew he had gone down the escalator and
13 absolutely should not have been pursued out of hearing
14 no communications by SO19. Esposito's answer was: just
15 got to carry on, have to do it wherever. We say this is
16 an entirely irresponsible approach to this, given all
17 the factors we have said so far, so that in relation to
18 the situation she faced, once he was on the escalators,
19 knowing that SO12 had offered basically to do a covert,
20 they should have continued, in fact they would not have
21 needed to because they would in fact have done it before
22 the line in the sand had been drawn.
23 So therefore we have reached a situation in which
24 officers are going down an escalator having been given
25 a command by her, and we have something to say about the
117
1 command, I will be very quick, namely, "Stop him before
2 he gets on the tube" or words to that effect, reiterated
3 twice to Ralph because he wants to be clear about it.
4 And therefore we get to a situation in which the lead
5 firearms officers have in their minds, that is C12 and
6 C2, that he has to be stopped before, although they may
7 be thinking he has already got on to a train and
8 possibly departed because of what they had heard before
9 going down a escalator.
10 Now, C2 and C12, if I can move to them because it's
11 in the last few minutes, that stage of the operation in
12 which the command team play no part because they are out
13 of communications.
14 May I just point out it is of some interest to note
15 that both the Commissioner's submissions and the command
16 team's submissions both say essentially they are not
17 involved, the decision to shoot -- we say not in
18 self-defence -- was taken by the two when they and after
19 they enter the carriage.
20 So they both say, their submissions, the officers
21 had no preconceptions. Now, Mr Stern on behalf of these
22 two has emphasised concessions. In fact, what I did
23 with both C2 and C12 which is why their extracts are in
24 the bundle as well, was to ask them whether there was
25 a possibility, and in fact suggest the possibility that
118
1 as they went down and I actually demonstrated, as you go
2 down the escalator, that was it, he was a dead man, you
3 were going to shoot him.
4 Interestingly, Mr Stern's clients both categorically
5 rejected that, and the command team and
6 the Commissioner's team both say neither officer had any
7 preconception. That is really very, very important.
8 It's not what I put to a witness, it's what the witness
9 says that becomes important.
10 The officers are saying, "We go down, we approach
11 covertly", and of course I am not leaving out the fact
12 that they have information that they think it's him and
13 that the him is a failed suicide bomber from the day
14 before. But of course none of that is enough to
15 literally trigger self-defence, because they have this
16 vital exercise which they have been put in by the
17 command team to assess whether in fact, even if they
18 thought he was a bomber that day, they still had to
19 assess, but they are saying they didn't think he was
20 a bomber that day, before they got to the carriage.
21 They had to assess then, in five to ten seconds,
22 whether this man presented an immediate threat. I do
23 not need to go through what they are claiming, because
24 I think the division in factual dispute which is part of
25 the factual questions we suggest should be put in any
119
1 event, are very stark between -- and this is quite
2 unlike a lot of the other cases dealing with officers
3 pleading self-defence -- where there is a plethora of
4 civilian witnesses who are sitting there, none of whom
5 describe the approach described by these two officers.
6 The most important of which is, I have called it the
7 cameo described by C12, namely it's the most critical
8 part of his assessment. It has to be. He then wonders
9 later why he ever asked this, and we wonder whether in
10 fact he did say this, but his evidence is that he shouts
11 "armed police". He's doing it, directing it towards
12 de Menezes, with a gun held up towards or in the face.
13 That's the cameo.
14 If it's going to be fudged and say well, maybe there
15 was a shout of "armed police" from the platform, we
16 heard "armed police" there, no, that's the key
17 assessment that he is making: I shout "armed police", I
18 lift my gun up and much to my amazement he continues.
19 On that, I understand the argument that an officer
20 may lie because he doesn't think the truth will be
21 believed, but this is a long way from that. This is
22 a situation in which an officer has described something
23 first of all that no other police officer who was in
24 a position to see, I am not counting those who had not
25 got there, the ones who were in a position to see, and
120
1 I can indicate who they are if necessary, none of those
2 support that version, none. Of course they may not have
3 seen it. Let's allow for that. They don't support that
4 cameo approach, "armed police", gun up.
5 Secondly, for these two police officers it's worse
6 than that, because the passengers describe something
7 quite different. So this jury plainly have material on
8 which they could reject the argument of self-defence.
9 We say there is sufficient evidence here on, whether
10 it's the modified Galbraith test or any form of
11 Galbraith test, capable of giving rise to, using the
12 modified test, a safe verdict that a jury may conclude
13 these officers, because C2 is in a worse position. He
14 doesn't issue any command or warning. He goes straight
15 in behind, he doesn't see C12 do what he's just
16 indicated. He goes straight over, puts the gun to the
17 head and then shouts "armed police", useless at that
18 point.
19 So therefore this huge division between what the
20 officers claim or at least one of them claims happened
21 as they entered the carriage, and what certainly the
22 civilians say happened and the lack of support for C12
23 in relation to the critical moment at which he makes the
24 assessment, there can't have been much more time in five
25 to ten seconds other than what he claims, will have to
121
1 be a matter for this jury in relation to the threshold
2 which we say has been crossed.
3 So it's not, as in some cases, I am not relying on
4 the bulky jacket argument at all. That was
5 a Divisional Court argument which at that stage without
6 benefit of all the materials that are now -- these
7 officers didn't give evidence at the Health and Safety
8 trial. These officers refused to be interviewed in
9 detail. I am not saying that's a criticism. They were
10 not interviewed by the IPCC in the sense they answered
11 any questions. This is the first time these officers
12 have been taxed. Just on C2, very interesting what he
13 now claims. He now claims that he was going to do the
14 same as C12, "raise my gun and shout, 'armed police'"
15 but he didn't have time.
16 Interesting, he has never claimed that before.
17 So effectively these two officers' version of what
18 happened, it's not just a question of assessing whether
19 they themselves, in perceiving a bulky jacket, happened
20 to be, as the director thought, telling a lie to cover
21 the truth which may not be believed. One has to do a
22 strict assessment, is there an evidential threshold
23 which suggests that what they did on the train was what
24 one of the passengers indicated was a controlled
25 approach, they knew what they were doing, they had
122
1 an objective, he was dead, five to ten seconds. That is
2 something we say has well passed this evidential
3 threshold that has to be passed at this stage.
4 Sir, I see it's 1 o'clock. I will stop.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you very much indeed.
6 MR MANSFIELD: There are other matters but I will only put
7 them in writing if they are of consequence.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: In the light of what we subsequently
9 hear, all right.
10 MR MANSFIELD: Yes. Also, I have not addressed fully but by
11 implication I have addressed it, is the Divisional Court
12 and how they approached the whole matter and the Health
13 and Safety trial. I have tried to interleave them
14 a bit.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I do not need to trouble you about --
16 I understand the difference between the Divisional Court
17 approach and the approach that I have to take, which is
18 the modified Galbraith approach.
19 MR MANSFIELD: Yes. The other matter, of course, is 16.7,
20 inconsistency. I can put it in writing but I can put it
21 very shortly. I don't think there is a problem.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Nor do I, actually, but anybody else
23 who thinks there is, we can't identify from the jury's
24 verdict which of the 19 complaints made in the Health
25 and Safety trial the jury found proved, any one or more.
123
1 As far as Cressida Dick's, or the rider exculpating
2 Cressida Dick is concerned, it's a matter of, I suppose
3 at least an open question whether that's part of the
4 verdict or the outcome of the trial at all within the
5 meaning of section 16, even if it is the fact that
6 a Coroner's jury is expressly prevented from saying
7 anything about criminal liability or civil liability,
8 really means that it doesn't matter. Is that
9 summarising it?
10 MR MANSFIELD: It is.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: If anybody disagrees they will no doubt
12 be able to tell me hereon. Thank you very much,
13 Mr Mansfield. Shall we say please 10 to 2 for everybody
14 else.
15 (1.05 pm)
16 (The short adjournment)
17 (1.50 pm)
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Mr Mansfield, just before you
19 conclude --
20 MR MANSFIELD: I have concluded.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I know you have, that's why you have
22 something to ask you. In fairness to you I did press
23 you to skate over the last 10 minutes a bit quickly and
24 there is a question I want your help about.
25 On the case that you are putting, what do you say at
124
1 the moment that C2 and C12 pulled their respective
2 triggers, fired their respective shots, what do you say
3 their state of mind was?
4 MR MANSFIELD: Well, I have to put it the other way around,
5 in other words that these were shots not fired in
6 self-defence.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Doesn't quite answer the question.
8 MR MANSFIELD: No. I can't go further than that. Their
9 intention was to kill, and it wasn't --
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, I accept that.
11 MR MANSFIELD: I'm putting clearly --
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What do you say they perceived they
13 were facing?
14 MR MANSFIELD: This is a difficult one to answer, because
15 their evidence is they perceived an imminent threat,
16 there and then, that this man was going to blow up the
17 train. I am saying that he was an imminent threat then,
18 he was going to blow up the train, he was going to
19 detonate; that's their case.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, but what do you say they actually
21 perceived?
22 MR MANSFIELD: Well, all I can say is what they should have
23 perceived was somebody who needed to be detained and not
24 shot --
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: But if that is what they perceived, why
125
1 did they kill him?
2 MR MANSFIELD: Because in fact they were on a mission at
3 that point. They went in on a mission. The mission was
4 to stop him before he got on the tube, too late. He is
5 on the tube and they go covert and it's almost
6 an automatic response. They are in and they kill. And
7 I can't go beyond that because I really don't -- I can't
8 go inside the mind, I can't suggest --
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Forgive me, we have to. I have to get
10 inside their minds, don't I? Or the jury --
11 MR MANSFIELD: The jury have to determine -- no, we don't to
12 this extent: in other words, for example, I do not have
13 to get inside the mind in order to establish a motive.
14 So for example the fact that they went in and shot,
15 I haven't got into the business of: were you motivated
16 by the fact that you wanted to get rid of somebody who
17 you thought was a terrorist. I do not have to go that
18 far obviously in relation to this case. All I have to
19 show if I were, for example, a prosecutor in this case
20 is to negative self-defence. What motive they may have
21 had to actually kill is a separate matter. The
22 prosecution never have to prove motive. They often do
23 put forward motive but that's not the point. That's
24 different from intention. If there was an intention to
25 kill and it wasn't in the context of self-defence, which
126
1 is what we say, then that's an end to the matter. What
2 motives they may have had is another matter.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: To bring it into the context of
4 self-defence, the jury would have to be sure that they
5 did not genuinely believe that the people, the man in
6 front of them, presented an immediate mortal threat.
7 MR MANSFIELD: Correct.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What do you say they did perceive?
9 MR MANSFIELD: I am not sure -- I understand your question.
10 I don't know that I can answer it, because beyond saying
11 their perception was wrong, he was not an imminent
12 threat, they say he was, so therefore I can't replace
13 what they claim in their mind, other than to say you
14 can't have thought he was an immediate threat.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Are you not forced into saying they did
16 not perceive him to be an immediate mortal threat?
17 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, that is what I am saying.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: If that is their state of mind, they
19 did not perceive him to be an immediate mortal threat,
20 why did they kill him?
21 MR MANSFIELD: I do not have to answer that. That is the
22 motive question: why did they kill him. In any murder
23 case, you will often -- I don't say often. There have
24 been a number of murder cases in which the prosecution
25 say: we don't know why this happened but we are saying
127
1 this man killed. There may be all sorts of reasons or
2 motives why somebody kills, and the prosecution may not
3 be able to prove that. In other words they may not be
4 able to say why did you do it, and there will be
5 a dispute of fact as there is here.
6 All we are having to say and all we do say is
7 Jean Charles de Menezes was not a threat and was not
8 perceived to be a threat and these two individual
9 officers -- this is why the preconception is so
10 important, why it is being said they did not have any
11 preconceptions. And we are saying they went in and they
12 killed. Why they did that is difficult. There may be
13 a combination of motives as to why they did it. Whether
14 they were on auto response at that point having been
15 given an order, got to be stopped before he enters the
16 train and there he is, covert approach, he is on the
17 train and then Ivor gets in the way and so on, and they
18 see their job --
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The auto response is a neat way of
20 putting it, would have to be on the basis: we have been
21 given an instruction which to us means that he is
22 an immediate mortal threat.
23 MR MANSFIELD: Well, they deny that.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I know they do, but that's -- I am
25 asking you, I am interpreting what you are putting as
128
1 being their state of mind.
2 MR MANSFIELD: As I say, I am not able to supplant a state
3 of mind they deny. They deny it. We say they are not
4 right. They are not telling the truth about that.
5 There wasn't a genuine belief he was an imminent threat,
6 and it's a five and ten-second thing. I can't go beyond
7 that, and I don't think it would be fair to anybody if I
8 were to start speculating what was in their mind.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You can't do that, I appreciate that.
10 Very well, thank you very much indeed.
11 MR MANSFIELD: I am sorry not to be able to take it further.
12 The other matter, I'm sorry, that was pointed out
13 over the lunch break, I may have been misunderstood.
14 You posed a scenario to me of a robber.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Oh, the bullet that goes astray, yes.
16 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, and how far does it go and I may have
17 made an answer which could be misinterpreted.
18 I indicated, I think, it's at page 31, that I wasn't
19 meaning to intend that there was no duty to the armed
20 robber who the police officer or whatever correctly felt
21 justified in shooting. What I was saying was there was
22 no breach of that duty if he correctly --
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: No, I didn't misunderstand you. What
24 you are saying, you accept that there is no breach as
25 far as the robber is concerned, but there is still
129
1 a duty of care to the casual bystander who gets a bullet
2 through him.
3 MR MANSFIELD: I am saying there is a duty of care in fact
4 to both.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, there is no breach in relation to
6 the robber.
7 MR MANSFIELD: That's right.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: There may be a breach in relation to
9 the bystander.
10 MR MANSFIELD: Yes, that's it.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's what I understood you to mean.
12 MR MANSFIELD: That's what I meant to say. Thank you very
13 much.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you. Yes. Mr Horwell, I think.
15 You have just lost 10 minutes so I will give it to you
16 at the other end.
17 MR HORWELL: I won't be needing them, sir.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: All right. Yes, Mr Horwell.
19 Submissions by MR HORWELL
20 MR HORWELL: Before I start with the submissions I had
21 intended to make, can I just make a few observations on
22 what Mr Mansfield has said this morning, and they will
23 be short.
24 Mr Mansfield has reintroduced us this morning to
25 a few old friends from this inquest, one of them the
130
1 predetermined stop point, a point which in our
2 submission has gone.
3 The evidence against the viability and practicality
4 of a predetermined stop in respect of a multiple
5 dwelling building has been illustrated and emphasised by
6 numerous witnesses throughout the inquest, and
7 Mr Mansfield sought to take advantage from the fact that
8 Trojan 84 answered many of his questions in a favourable
9 manner. What Mr Mansfield did not then go on to mention
10 in his submissions, that unfortunately for him,
11 Trojan 84 answered many of the questions from Mr Perry
12 and myself in a favourable manner to us.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It's what you call keeping out of
14 harm's way.
15 MR HORWELL: It is.
16 Mr Mansfield's suggestion is based on the premise
17 that an identification can be made within this short
18 window of time, and, as you have heard from many
19 a witness, that simply is not possible.
20 Today, I believe for the first time in this inquest,
21 it is suggested that in fact the police should have
22 stopped anyone not excluded by the time they reached
23 a bus stop. How many men would that have been, during
24 the course of this morning? Men who could not
25 positively be excluded as being one of the two suicide
131
1 bombers.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: If you extend it to associates, it
3 wouldn't be women either.
4 MR HORWELL: Exactly, and the point that has repeatedly been
5 made that armed interventions are dangerous in the best
6 of circumstances, therefore they are not conducted
7 unless necessary, and the covert, the vital importance
8 of this operation remaining covert.
9 How many stops in and around Scotia Road would it
10 have taken for this operation to have lost that
11 essential element? And what we suggest is that each and
12 every time criticism is made, and each and every time
13 a different tactic has been suggested, we believe that
14 one of the most reasonable and practical ways of dealing
15 with such criticism and suggested tactic is to do what
16 DAC Dick suggested in the course of her evidence, when
17 she said to Mr Mansfield, when Mr Mansfield was putting
18 to her what she should have done, and I think it was in
19 relation to SO12 conducting the arrest, when DAC Dick
20 said:
21 "If I had done that, what on earth do you think you
22 would have been asking me now?"
23 That approach of hers is one that we commend to the
24 court, because every single time criticism is made: why
25 didn't you stop in this window of opportunity, stop any
132
1 male who could not be excluded from being a suicide
2 bomber, and that male might have acted in
3 a non-compliant way, and been shot; we can easily
4 imagine the criticism that then would have been made;
5 your threshold of identification was far too low, you
6 were stopping anyone who could not be excluded as being
7 a bomber, why didn't you wait? That would have been the
8 suggestion, and so on.
9 What the last seven weeks have demonstrated beyond
10 doubt is the enormous complexity and difficulty of this
11 police operation. At every single stage, almost,
12 a dilemma was faced and on more than one occasion we
13 have heard the comment "damned if you do and damned if
14 you don't". That is why we have suggested that many of
15 the criticisms and suggestions are made with the
16 glorious benefit of hindsight in this case, because
17 DAC Dick was absolutely right: "Look at these
18 suggestions, look at these recommendations, and then ask
19 yourself what would have happened had I taken that
20 different course, and the operation would have had
21 an equally tragic effect".
22 We believe that that approach highlights the
23 difficulties that the police faced with failed suicide
24 bombers, the answer to which even to this day is not
25 known.
133
1 Can I mention the other matters raised by
2 Mr Mansfield this morning. Criticism is made of the
3 lack of communication in the operations room and at the
4 same time it is suggested there were in fact too many
5 police officers in the operations room. The two cannot
6 stand together.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, I don't know, too many police
8 officers can get into the way of lines of communication
9 if they have nothing useful to do.
10 MR HORWELL: Yes, but they all had a function and whatever
11 the level of noise that may have been in that room, it
12 is a nonsense to suggest that no-one could have
13 communicated to Dick that which was necessary.
14 Comment was made as to Trojan 84's evidence that his
15 officers were placed in an outrageous position and, sir,
16 you understood, we suggest correctly, the manner in
17 which Trojan 84 gave that evidence. If one were to read
18 on a few lines in the course of his evidence, he said
19 this:
20 "We can't do it any other way."
21 That is the spirit in which that evidence was given.
22 Again, it is suggested, notwithstanding all of the
23 evidence that we have heard on this topic, that SO12
24 should have been ordered to do the stop. Well,
25 I needn't repeat all of the arguments that have been set
134
1 out, but we have recently reminded ourselves of
2 something that Dick said in evidence, which was that in
3 the last eight years -- whether that's eight years from
4 now or eight years from 2005, I cannot remember -- SO12
5 only intervened once.
6 It may be something that boy scouts can play at
7 around the campfire, but it's really not a sensible
8 suggestion when the stakes were as high as these, in our
9 submission.
10 Mr Mansfield has referred to the very short time
11 that C2 and C12 had in the carriage. He put it at five
12 to ten seconds. It must have been less. And that
13 limited time would have been the case wherever the stop
14 would have taken place. So the carriage is not
15 exceptional in that regard. You have heard on a number
16 of occasions that a stop of this nature is only safe to
17 the firearms officers if conducted at a distance of
18 50 yards or so behind cover. That was never going to be
19 possible that morning, and therefore wherever the stop
20 took place, time was going to be very limited.
21 Now can I turn to our summary of the law, and fact.
22 There are plainly two quite distinct stages to this part
23 of the process. The first is for you to decide which of
24 the proposed verdicts should be left, and the only issue
25 here is whether or not there is sufficient evidence to
135
1 leave any one of the routes to unlawful killing. That
2 is the only issue.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, in the context -- yes.
4 MR HORWELL: At this stage.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I mean, you have taken -- you have
6 an overall responsibility for both C2 and C12 and the
7 control officers, yes.
8 MR HORWELL: That's right.
9 And the second, quite distinct stage is, consequent
10 upon that decision, in what form the inquisition should
11 then take. For our part, and we believe for others, it
12 would be extremely helpful if there was any possibility
13 of having a ruling from you -- not the reasons,
14 obviously -- before going to the second stage. We say
15 that for this reason: making submissions on the form of
16 the inquisition in a vacuum is not only difficult, it's
17 somewhat artificial. We believe that we could be of
18 most assistance to the court if the two stages could be
19 divided by an intimation of your ruling on the first.
20 If it's not possible, then of course it's not
21 something for which we can press.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What are you suggesting? Well, I know
23 what you are suggesting.
24 MR HORWELL: By the time we have finished, and I believe
25 that there is an extremely good chance that the time
136
1 that you have allocated to the remaining interested
2 persons will not only not be exceeded, it will in fact
3 be significantly less than you have anticipated, and the
4 reason for that is obvious: everyone has spent
5 a considerable amount of time reducing their submissions
6 to writing, and it is a waste of everyone's time to
7 repeat those submissions this afternoon.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I do not want anybody to do that. Are
9 you really asking me -- I would have to hear everybody
10 --
11 MR HORWELL: Yes, of course.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: -- on the specific verdicts. Then
13 what? Do you want to go away again and produce
14 submissions in relation to the potential questions that
15 would be left on a narrative verdict?
16 MR HORWELL: We would certainly find it much more
17 constructive and helpful to the court if we could do it
18 in that way.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I understand that. I can't do that,
20 Mr Horwell. We are constrained overall as to our time.
21 This is the difficulty. I had hoped, and I suspect that
22 whatever I say, you are, in the light of the letter of
23 the 17th, that everybody is ready, even possibly with
24 less leisure than they would have liked, but everybody
25 is ready to make broadbrush submissions about the kind
137
1 of questions that you think should be left.
2 But actually more to the point, I do not really
3 think I am in a position to make my mind up.
4 MR HORWELL: Then, sir, I won't press the matter. We will
5 make our submissions.
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I would want, in some calm opportunity,
7 to think very hard about the submissions that
8 Mr Mansfield has made, and the ones that you are all
9 going to make to me.
10 MR HORWELL: Of course, we understand that.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I don't think I can do that.
12 MR HILLIARD: We will be in a position to make our
13 submissions on the inquisition tomorrow afternoon.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you very much.
15 MR HORWELL: Can I start, then, with a very short summary in
16 respect of the evidence in relation to C2 and C12. You
17 have, this afternoon, in our submission, identified and
18 crystallised the true problem in respect of the evidence
19 in relation to them when looking at the issue of
20 unlawful killing, namely that which you have raised with
21 Mr Mansfield, why did they kill him?
22 Mr Mansfield says that motive is irrelevant. Well,
23 in some cases it may be, where there is an imbalance of
24 mind suggested; but in a case of this nature, where the
25 balance of the mind of these two men is not an issue, it
138
1 is an extremely penetrating way of looking at this part
2 of the case, because what Mr Mansfield has in fact said
3 is that they went down the escalators to shoot him.
4 There was no discretion, there was no decision-making
5 process, this was an execution.
6 He has to put the case in that way, because in any
7 other way it does not make any conceivable sense, and
8 the matter, the moment that approach is identified, it
9 is obvious how flawed an approach it is, because there
10 is no evidence whatsoever that those two men went down
11 the escalators to shoot the man that would be identified
12 to them. For a jury to come to that conclusion, it
13 would be perverse, in our submission.
14 In respect of C2 and C12, there is quite simply no
15 evidence, or at least insufficient, to rebut the obvious
16 defence of self-defence. In respect of the first limb
17 of the defence, honest but mistaken belief --
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It's conceded.
19 MR HORWELL: Overwhelming in their favour, and it's
20 conceded.
21 The only logical interpretation is that not only did
22 they believe that it was Osman but that he was about to
23 detonate a bomb. No jury could reasonably determine to
24 the criminal standard that such belief was not honestly
25 held. Any finding to the contrary would be perverse,
139
1 and as to the second limb, as we said in our written
2 submissions, on this evidence it is but a very short
3 step to show that the evidence adduced has also failed
4 to disprove this second limb of the defence.
5 The evidence of C2 and C12 is strongly supported by
6 that of Ivor and D9, who did hear the words "armed
7 police".
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: A rather different place.
9 MR HORWELL: Yes, he said he couldn't say where they were
10 said.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: He was up on the concourse at the time.
12 MR HORWELL: This is in the carriage.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Oh, I beg your pardon. Yes.
14 MR HORWELL: This is in the carriage. He said he couldn't
15 specify where the words were spoken but that they were
16 spoken.
17 The only argument that the family has to present is
18 that the evidence of the civilian eyewitnesses is not in
19 accordance with that of the police officers. The
20 problem with that approach is that the evidence of the
21 eyewitnesses is not in accordance --
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Forgive me. I thought it was. My
23 screen has suddenly stopped moving. Could we have
24 a five minute break to sort it out?
25 MR HORWELL: Of course.
140
1 (2.25 pm)
2 (A short break)
3 (2.28 pm)
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
5 MR HORWELL: The only approach that the family can offer is
6 to suggest that the evidence of the eyewitnesses is
7 different to that of the police officers and, as I was
8 saying, the principal flaw in that approach is that of
9 course the eyewitness evidence itself contradicts the
10 eyewitness evidence.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Internally.
12 MR HORWELL: Yes. You cannot use the eyewitness evidence to
13 construct what happened, because if you did, you would
14 have people firing into the carriage from outside, you
15 would have Arabs firing into the roof of the carriage,
16 and many other actions and words spoken that cannot have
17 happened or cannot have been said at the time before the
18 shooting.
19 As we have set out in our written submissions, the
20 eyewitness evidence neither proves nor disproves the
21 evidence from the police officers as to what was said or
22 what happened. Although it is of itself interesting, as
23 again we have set out, in that it does, in our
24 submission, offer support for the fact that
25 Mr de Menezes stood up and advanced, which we submit is
141
1 the most important part of the description of what
2 occurred inside. We refer, of course, to the evidence
3 of Preston and Whitby, and the Asian man.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Ivor.
5 MR HORWELL: Ivor, and the rugby huddle or scrum which took
6 place outside of the seat. That is only consistent, in
7 our submission, with Mr de Menezes having got out of his
8 seat, and having got out of his seat he was obviously
9 going to move, he wasn't going to stay there, and move
10 forwards. That is significant corroboration of a vital
11 part of the evidence of those police officers.
12 Again, it is interesting, bearing in mind the
13 criticism of C2 and C12 as to their recollection of
14 a bulky jacket. It is interesting again, as we set out
15 in our submissions, that Whitby referred to the bulky
16 jacket of Ivor when we know that he did not have a bulky
17 jacket.
18 It simply goes to demonstrate the difficulty that
19 witnesses have in this situation, and C2 and C12 have
20 set out in their written submissions part of the
21 judgment of --
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The bulky jacket's today somewhat
23 diminished into the background.
24 MR HORWELL: It seems that it's gone, which -- it was
25 a point that was at the forefront of the application
142
1 before the Administrative Court, and it has now gone.
2 It's also important to bear in mind that the
3 eyewitness evidence hasn't changed. The evidence that
4 we heard in this courtroom was that which appeared in
5 the witness statements, and those witness statements
6 have been available for a very long time.
7 Nothing, in our submission, is achieved by further
8 elaboration. Our submission is a very straightforward
9 one: there is simply not enough evidence in relation to
10 C2 and C12 to rebut self-defence. That must bring
11 an end --
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: On the criminal burden of proof?
13 MR HORWELL: On the criminal burden of proof. And that must
14 bring an end to murder.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well.
16 MR HORWELL: We then move to gross negligence, manslaughter.
17 And the family has identified McDowall, Dick, and
18 Esposito as three officers against whom the family says
19 there is evidence of such an offence. That claim is not
20 accepted in any form on behalf of the Commissioner.
21 The House of Lords in Adomako set the threshold for
22 this offence at a very high level, and that level is
23 justified because this is a grave offence, it carries
24 life imprisonment as a maximum sentence, and it does not
25 require mens rea. And therefore the suggestion and
143
1 allegation is a very difficult one to make, and
2 difficult to substantiate, in our submission.
3 There are four ingredients to the offence, each of
4 them must be proved, and we submit that there is
5 insufficient evidence to establish any one of the four
6 ingredients. We only need succeed in relation to one of
7 the four, and this offence must go at this stage. But
8 we submit there is in fact insufficient or no evidence
9 in respect of each of the four ingredients.
10 We start, of course, with duty of care. We make it
11 clear, in case there is any misunderstanding, these
12 submissions have nothing to do with the issue of
13 compensation. As you may be aware, interim ex gratia
14 payments have been made --
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I wasn't, but I am not surprised.
16 MR HORWELL: And will continue to be made as appropriate.
17 We do not want anyone to think that these submissions
18 are being advanced with that in mind.
19 The issue as to whether or not the police owe a duty
20 of care in situations such as this is one of great
21 importance to the police force in general, as you can
22 well imagine. And there are certain circumstances or
23 relationships in which the courts have held that a duty
24 of care is owed. An obvious example is road traffic
25 incidents. In respect --
144
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Are you thinking of Knightley?
2 MR HORWELL: Yes.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: A case for which I have a particular
4 affection. If you ever read the whole report, you will
5 see why.
6 MR HORWELL: I will look at it afresh. In our submission,
7 the courts have taken a policy decision, and it's not
8 difficult to see why, police officers are treated as
9 drivers like anyone else. To that extent a duty of care
10 is owed to other road users.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Even in cases of emergency.
12 MR HORWELL: Yes, and so it is a situation very different
13 indeed from that which faces this court. Some of the
14 authorities have sought to support the view by saying
15 this is the civil duty of a police officer, not
16 a criminal duty. If that approach is correct, it
17 explains the reason for why there is a duty of care.
18 Relationships, special relationships such as police
19 and informant. Again, it is very easy to understand why
20 a duty of care would be owed.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You take on a special relationship with
22 him.
23 MR HORWELL: Exactly.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You have to look after him.
25 MR HORWELL: Exactly.
145
1 The cases that have been cited, both for and against
2 the proposition, I will only look now at a few of them
3 because of course we have set out in detail in our
4 written submissions what our case is. I am not even
5 going to refer to Hill itself. The principle in Hill is
6 very clear. But how is that principle applied? The
7 case that is referred to by academic writers, because
8 not many of these cases actually exist, which is cases
9 in which a duty of care has been imposed, which is
10 a very good starting point for looking at this
11 principle. The courts are reluctant to impose a duty of
12 care. One of them, of course, is Rigby.
13 One of the problems with Rigby is that it was before
14 Hill.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: But it's been approved since.
16 MR HORWELL: It certainly has, at a very high level. But
17 that is a fact that, in our submission, must be borne in
18 mind.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, what are you saying about it?
20 MR HORWELL: Well, the odd --
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Are you limiting it to its peculiar
22 facts?
23 MR HORWELL: The odd part about Rigby when looked at from
24 this particular perspective is that the principle of
25 duty of care does not arise in the judgment at all, and
146
1 therefore either one assumes it must have been conceded,
2 and if conceded, that is not a concession that in any
3 sense --
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The report doesn't say so. Lord Taylor
5 might have thought it was self-evident.
6 MR HORWELL: I do not know.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You mustn't mind me pulling your leg.
8 MR HORWELL: No, it's pulled frequently from those behind
9 me. We do submit that there are certain weaknesses to
10 Rigby, to use Rigby in support of this proposition, when
11 it doesn't even deal with the issue of duty of care,
12 shows the weakness of that use.
13 That's how we put our case on Rigby. But there are
14 other features that can be taken from it that assist in
15 our submission.
16 First of all, the action was of course against the
17 Chief Constable who was vicariously liable for those
18 officers on the ground. Vicarious liability does not
19 apply in the circumstances before you.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: They took a positive step by firing CS
21 gas canisters into the building which effectively, as it
22 turns out in the circumstances that existed, there were
23 some unavoidable consequences, the house caught fire.
24 Now, speaking entirely for myself, trying to put myself
25 in the position that I would have been in if I had been
147
1 trying that case, I would have thought I would have come
2 to the conclusion that that was a direct operational
3 act.
4 Now, you may say that the distinction between
5 operational and investigatory is a false one, I don't
6 know. But that is the basis upon which it's been put
7 forward in some very highly authoritative cases.
8 I would have thought that was the short answer to Rigby.
9 But you may tell me I am wrong.
10 MR HORWELL: It's important to bear in mind the duty that
11 was said to have been breached. I'll read from
12 page 1256 of the judgment. It's only a few words:
13 "I conclude that the defendant, by his officers, was
14 negligent in failing to react to the departure of the
15 Green Goddess by seeking other help and in using the
16 canister without any fire-fighting equipment."
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I see, it's two things, it's using the
18 gas canisters, and (b) as you say not ensuring that
19 there was an adequate fire-fighting capacity there.
20 MR HORWELL: We interpret the judgment as meaning that the
21 breach here was not having fire-fighting equipment on
22 standby, notwithstanding the fact that this was a fire
23 service strike and notwithstanding the fact that
24 Green Goddesses were very rare.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It is two-fold, isn't it, if you have
148
1 not got a fire engine standing by, even an
2 unsatisfactory one, you mustn't fire canisters into the
3 house.
4 MR HORWELL: I have interpreted this in a more limited way,
5 simply because the psychopath inside the building was
6 firing shots, and so there was an emergency, and it's
7 not so much the decision to fire the canisters --
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: As to do so without the fire brigade
9 present.
10 MR HORWELL: That's how we have interpreted it. So
11 an analogy here, if it's of any use at all, is if the
12 police know in advance that somebody is going to be
13 harmed, not having an ambulance there, for example. So
14 that is why we say it is of limited value.
15 But the other case to which significant reference
16 has been made, Hartwell --
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's the firearms one, isn't it?
18 MR HORWELL: Yes. It is a case which we pray in aid. It's
19 not one which is contrary to our argument. It's for
20 that reason that I would like to spend a few moments,
21 it's in file 3 of the authorities at tab 53.
22 Because it's important to note what the duty of care
23 was, and what the Privy Council had to say about it.
24 The facts are fairly memorable, and can be taken quickly
25 from the headnote at page 1273.
149
1 This is in the Royal Virgin Islands, a police
2 officer had been given a sidearm, and he was a most
3 inappropriate character to have that weapon. In his
4 past were two incidents, one in which he had threatened
5 another man with a knife in a confrontation over his
6 girlfriend, and the second was when he had been seen
7 walking about with a gun which he had taken from the
8 police station without permission and in circumstances
9 for which he had no adequate explanation.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: One of the great pleasures of sitting
11 in the Privy Council is that you get the opportunity to
12 hear cases like this.
13 MR HORWELL: Thankfully we don't have them here. So those
14 are the very unusual circumstances. If we look at the
15 reasons for the judgment and the specific duty of care
16 that was imposed by the court, if we go to page 1281 and
17 to paragraph 31, this is after reference to the --
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Paragraph?
19 MR HORWELL: Paragraph 31. The paragraph numbers are
20 a little difficult to see on this report.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Got it.
22 MR HORWELL: Having dealt with the relevant authorities, the
23 present case:
24 "When applying these principles in the present case
25 two factual features of cardinal importance stand out.
150
1 This case does not fall on the 'omissions' side of the
2 somewhat imprecise boundary line separating liability
3 for acts from liability for admissions. In a police
4 case this distinction is important. Here the police are
5 not sought to be made liable for failure to carry out
6 their police duties properly. This is not a case such
7 as Hill ... where liability was sought to be imposed on
8 the police in respect of an alleged failure to
9 investigate the Sutcliffe murders properly. In the
10 present case the police authorities were in possession
11 of a gun and ammunition. They took the positive step of
12 providing [the PC] with access to that gun. [He] did
13 not break into the strongbox and steal [it]. The police
14 authorities gave him the key. True, [he] disobeyed
15 orders in taking the gun as he did. But the fact
16 remains that the police authorities chose to entrust
17 [him], who was on the island by himself, with ready
18 access to a weapon and the ammunition needed for its
19 use. The question is whether in taking that positive
20 step the ... police ... owed [the victim] a relevant
21 duty."
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, it's another example of a positive
23 step.
24 MR HORWELL: Yes, and if we go to the bottom of that page,
25 paragraph 37:
151
1 "In the present case the police authorities plainly
2 owed a duty to take reasonable care to see that police
3 officers to whom they entrusted firearms were competent
4 and suitable. But to whom was that duty owed ..."
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: By parity of reasoning, if they took
6 the step to fire canisters into a house, they owed a
7 positive duty to ensure that such precautions as could
8 be taken were taken to ensure the house didn't catch
9 fire.
10 MR HORWELL: Yes, that's from Rigby, of course.
11 So the duty of care that was owed to the victim
12 wasn't a duty owed to the victim himself. It was a duty
13 owed to the public. All that Hartwell is an authority
14 for is that the police owe the public a duty to
15 ensure --
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: To those who were within the reasonable
17 contemplation of the people taking the decision. So
18 it's not necessarily the public at large, it's the
19 people into whose contact that particular officer could
20 be expected to come.
21 MR HORWELL: Yes, which in this case was in fact the public
22 at large.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, it was the customers in the bar,
24 anyway, if nothing else. Yes. I am not saying that you
25 would necessarily have had a different result if he had
152
1 gone off around the other side of the island and shot
2 somebody else. He would have had the same result. It's
3 a question of what's foreseeable.
4 MR HORWELL: Yes. In fact, I am reminded, if we carry on,
5 at paragraph 39 we do have articulated by the court the
6 actual duty.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
8 MR HORWELL: "When entrusting a police officer with a gun,
9 the police authorities owe to the public at large a duty
10 to take reasonable care to see the officer is a suitable
11 person."
12 So it is as wide as I had suggested.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Because they have taken a positive step
14 and put a dangerous article into the hands of
15 a dangerous person, yes.
16 MR HORWELL: Yes, so by analogy if C2 and C12 had been
17 incompetent, dangerous police officers, of which not
18 only is there no evidence but all of the evidence is to
19 the contrary, there would have been a duty in those
20 circumstances owed to the public at large and therefore
21 of course Mr de Menezes.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
23 MR HORWELL: Before we leave this particular line of
24 authority, it again may be instructive to note that the
25 duty in Rigby was to the owner of the premises, not to
153
1 the psychopath inside. So it's to the owner of the
2 property, not to the suspect, if that's the right word,
3 the criminal in the building.
4 If we now turn to the numerically greater
5 authorities that support our proposition, we can see
6 exactly how wide-ranging they are. If I could, for ease
7 of reference, refer you to our written document.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, I have it out.
9 MR HORWELL: If we start at page 44 it will be a lot
10 quicker. As I have said, I am only going to refer to
11 six or seven cases, and I'll do so briefly. They
12 illustrate the significant reluctance of the courts to
13 impose a duty of care upon the police in relation to
14 suspects.
15 If we start at page 44 with L and P, L was the
16 father of a daughter, and the mother falsely accused P
17 of abusing the daughter. It's not only the mother that
18 behaved improperly. There were serious and supported
19 allegations made against the police in that case, they
20 tried to trick P into making a confession.
21 The relevant part of the judgment, if we go to
22 page 45 of our written argument, paragraph 19 of the
23 judgment:
24 "Mr Faulks contended that the learned judge was
25 correct to hold that no duty of care was owed to the
154
1 father in negligence as there was an insufficient
2 relationship of proximity with him. The second
3 appellant was a suspect in a potential crime. He was
4 being interviewed as such. It cannot objectively be
5 said that there was any assumption of responsibility to
6 him when judged against that context. The relationship
7 between police officer and victim is one of conflict or
8 potential conflict. The class which the second
9 appellant belonged, namely potential suspects of crime,
10 is too wide for a relationship of proximity to exist."
11 Now, it is again worth bearing in mind that, at the
12 time of this impropriety, P was in custody at the police
13 station, being interviewed, and notwithstanding the fact
14 that the police had arrested him, placed him in custody,
15 and were interviewing him, notwithstanding that
16 relationship and that assumption -- one could argue --
17 of some responsibility, the court held that the
18 relationship was not sufficiently proximate for there to
19 be a duty of care.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That part of the judgment
21 Sir Philip Otton upheld.
22 MR HORWELL: Yes.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: He went on to say, however, that there
24 was another aspect which effectively meant that the
25 appeal was allowed.
155
1 MR HORWELL: Yes, but it's a different duty of care. It
2 arose, I believe, once P was no longer a suspect. It
3 was the relationship they owed to him when considering
4 what to do in relation to the daughter.
5 I appreciate of course there is no firearms element,
6 but to have a man arrested and in your custody --
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: While he was a suspect they owed him no
8 duty. Thereafter, what the police were really -- once
9 they have eliminated that, they had gone on to consider
10 what you might call the family relationship aspect of
11 the case and at that stage a duty of care arose.
12 MR HORWELL: Yes.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I see.
14 MR HORWELL: The point is repeated, and I can deal with this
15 very quickly, over the page to 46, the authority of
16 Vellino is referred to over towards the bottom of the
17 page. Lord Justice Schiemann dealt with a very similar
18 principle, namely the relationship that the police owe
19 to a person arrested.
20 This is the specific duty of care that is owed to
21 somebody in detention. If one goes over the page to 47,
22 middle of the page, paragraph 15 of the judgment:
23 "For my part I am content to assume without so
24 deciding that when a police officer arrests a citizen,
25 the police officer puts himself in a relationship with
156
1 that prisoner which can involve the police officer in
2 having some duties for the breach of which the prisoner
3 can sue. But in every case, one has to identify the
4 particular duty which it is that has allegedly been
5 broken."
6 To the bottom of the page, four lines up from the
7 bottom:
8 "It is not the arrest which gives rise to the duty
9 of care to the man. It is his detention."
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The two things may be coincidental of
11 course.
12 MR HORWELL: Yes, but the duty of care referred to here is
13 the duty to look after the prisoner properly at the
14 police station: which cells you put him in, how do you
15 care for him.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, it's the element of detention that
17 gives rise to the duty of care.
18 MR HORWELL: Yes.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: If you are arrested and then bailed,
20 there is no special duty.
21 MR HORWELL: No.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It's, as you say, keeping him in proper
23 accommodation.
24 MR HORWELL: Yes, but it's not even the arrest that creates
25 the duty. It's the detention. One follows the other
157
1 ordinarily, but it's an important distinction that was
2 made in Vellino, in our submission.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
4 MR HORWELL: So not even a duty owed up until the time of
5 arrest, and not only the arrest creates the duty,
6 an inevitable consequence of an arrest is detention, of
7 course, but --
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What about helping the police with
9 their enquiries?
10 MR HORWELL: It would depend on the circumstances.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Police officers are usually careful to
12 say, "You are free to go if you want to".
13 MR HORWELL: Yes, but in this particular circumstance not
14 even the arrest creates a duty of care --
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It's the consequential detention.
16 MR HORWELL: Yes, and that's an important distinction.
17 Page 48, reference has been made to Farrell this
18 morning. This is the Irish case in which the Court of
19 Appeal held that the Ministry of Defence and soldiers
20 for whose actions it is responsible owed a duty to take
21 reasonable care in the conduct of security operations to
22 every person, including actual and suspected offenders.
23 That is the part that was referred to this morning.
24 We need, in our submission, to see what Lord Dilhorne
25 had to say about that decision of the Court of Appeal in
158
1 Ireland, because over the page to 49, that quotation at
2 the top of the page, last three lines:
3 "I do not propose to comment on the views expressed
4 on this question by the Court of Appeal, but it is not
5 to be assumed that I agree with them."
6 I hope it is not being fanciful or overoptimistic to
7 suggest that it is clear what Lord Dilhorne meant by
8 that comment.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It depends what submissions were
10 addressed to their Lordships' House. It may be that the
11 parties had come to the conclusion that the other aspect
12 of the appeal was all they needed to argue.
13 MR HORWELL: I am sure that was certainly the reasoning
14 behind the decision, but it is a clear indication from
15 that level that the decision from the Irish Court of
16 Appeal --
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: He was not to be taken to be approving.
18 That's about as far as it goes.
19 MR HORWELL: Yes, but it is worth bearing in mind when the
20 case itself is referred to.
21 Another Irish case, page 57 of our document,
22 Fitzsimmons. This was a bank robbery, and the police
23 were waiting in the bank, or the Post Office as it was,
24 for the robbers.
25 This was a decision of Lord Justice Carswell, as he
159
1 then was, and he dealt with the decision which did not
2 involve a duty of care.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Self-defence succeeded in this case.
4 MR HORWELL: Yes. He then went on to deal, even though he
5 didn't have to, it's one of those occasions of a judge
6 not having to deal with a point, but deciding --
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Which means it's obiter.
8 MR HORWELL: Yes, but from that source, I think we can use
9 it with some effect, I would like to think.
10 What he had to say, if one starts at the bottom of
11 page 58, five lines up from the bottom:
12 "The mere foreseeability of likely harm in the
13 circumstances was not by itself enough to give rise to
14 the duty [an obvious point but one that should not be
15 lost sight of]. Some further ingredient must be present
16 to establish the requisite proximity of relationship
17 between the plaintiff and the defendant."
18 Over the page, he referred to Alexandrou v Oxford,
19 that's the shop premises and the burglar alarm, no duty
20 of care owed there.
21 Having referred to this, he then in his speech went
22 on to, in his judgment, the part that is underlined on
23 that page:
24 "If the deceased in the present case had been
25 a member of the public accidentally hit by a bullet
160
1 fired by the police at the robbers, it would appear
2 arguable whether on the proper application of this
3 principle, he could have recovered against the police in
4 an action for negligence. If a member of the public
5 could not so succeed, it is difficult to see how
6 a higher duty could be owed to a fleeing criminal."
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Lord Carswell didn't actually have the
8 hardihood to decide the point then and there.
9 MR HORWELL: No. Well, he couldn't because --
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It wasn't in front of him.
11 MR HORWELL: For the decision, but it is an instructive
12 comment by him as to the principle that we advance.
13 Two cases then follow at pages 60 and 61 of our
14 written submissions, Elguzouli and Kumar. Elguzouli was
15 not a police case, it's a CPS case. But it's
16 instructive again, we submit, to bear in mind that the
17 Court of Appeal decided in Elguzouli for public policy
18 reasons that the Crown Prosecution Service did not owe
19 a duty of care to those it was considering as to whether
20 or not they should be prosecuted.
21 It's helpful, we submit, to bear in mind again the
22 extreme nature of the facts in Elguzouli. The Crown
23 Prosecution Service acted in a poor way to that
24 individual, as they did in Kumar. But no duty of care.
25 The recent case in the House of Lords, Van Colle and
161
1 Smith, we set out the facts and the judgments from
2 page 67 in our written argument. One can, on occasions,
3 spend too much time on the principles and the law and
4 forget the facts. The facts in Smith, as we have
5 suggested, are extreme, and Lord Brown, at the top of
6 our page 68, described them as being "really very
7 strong".
8 This was a man who had been assaulted because he
9 wished to end his relationship with another man, had
10 been assaulted, reported that assault to the police. He
11 had moved away to Brighton. He received extremely
12 threatening messages by telephone, text and internet,
13 "You are dead", "Look out for yourself, psycho is
14 coming", "I am looking to kill you, no compromises",
15 "I was in the pub last night with a carving knife, it's
16 a shame I missed you".
17 He reported those messages and the history to the
18 Brighton police. They said it would take four weeks to
19 trace the calls. He then goes to London. The messages
20 continued. He reports the matter to the London police.
21 They say, "Contact the Brighton police". He contacts
22 the Brighton police. Not a lot of interest is shown by
23 the inspector, who doesn't even bother to look at his
24 phone to see the actual text messages. He's simply
25 told: well, phone 999 if there is a problem. And he is
162
1 then assaulted with a hammer, receiving significant
2 brain damage.
3 Now, those are, as we suggest, extreme
4 circumstances, and the House of Lords held that no duty
5 of care arose. Such is the importance of this
6 principle.
7 Can I finally -- we did not deal with this in our
8 written submissions. It's a case which has only just
9 been added. If your authorities file has been added to
10 last night or this morning, do you have a tab 59?
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Heagren?
12 MR HORWELL: Yes, thank you, that's the case. The facts are
13 very simple. If we go to the first page of the judgment
14 of Lord Justice Kennedy. The police had information, it
15 only takes a few moments to read:
16 "... 'a named person, and up to four other men,
17 would be knee-capped by shooters ... shooting was to be
18 carried out by Peter [who] had a sawn-off shotgun in
19 a garage. He would be assisted by a man called Jim of
20 Canons Walk in Thetford'."
21 Well, the police went armed to Canons Walk in
22 Thetford to arrest Jim, who was Jim Heagren. The
23 arrest, as one would expect, was somewhat dramatic in
24 the circumstances. The information was false, and
25 Mr Heagren wanted to sue. Unfortunately the pages
163
1 aren't numbered.
2 If the start of the judgment we call page 1, two
3 pages on to page 3, the ground of appeal which Mr Money
4 put in the forefront. Do you have that? We don't have
5 paragraphs either. (Pause). Page 4 of the actual
6 report, the third page of the written judgment.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you, wait a minute. I have
8 execution of warrant.
9 MR HORWELL: That's it.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you. Yes, I see. Yes, yes.
11 MR HORWELL: Now, obviously the point was taken that there
12 was no duty of care, and one can see how
13 Lord Justice Kennedy dismissed any argument to suggest
14 that there was a duty of care:
15 "In my judgment the judge was right to withdraw that
16 issue, as can be seen from the decision of the House of
17 Lords in Hill ... In that case Lord Keith, with whom
18 three other members of the House expressly agreed, made
19 it clear beyond argument that an action for damages in
20 negligence against the police simply cannot be sustained
21 in circumstances of the kind with which we are concerned
22 in the present case."
23 The circumstances in the present case were false
24 information upon which the police acted, and they
25 arrested Mr Heagren as a suspect, and no duty of care
164
1 was owed. That was an arrest in relation to --
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: There was a claim in trespass, wasn't
3 there?
4 MR HORWELL: As inevitably is the case in these actions,
5 there were claims under every heading conceivable, but
6 that part of the judgment dealt with negligence.
7 We have sought to identify the difficulty in the
8 argument that must be advanced by the family by seeking
9 to turn it round and ask: what is the duty of care that
10 the police owe to a suspected suicide bomber? We
11 haven't been able to articulate a sensible duty of care.
12 From the argument that has been advanced at times,
13 indeed it's an observation that your own counsel made in
14 their written document, can it be the case that a duty
15 of care is owed to an innocent person but not to
16 a guilty person? Well, that's re-writing the law of
17 negligence, in our submission. The existence of a duty
18 of care cannot depend on the actual status of
19 an individual. If there is a duty of care, it is owed
20 to the class of suspect. It cannot depend upon whether
21 that suspect is ultimately acquitted or convicted.
22 There cannot be a post facto assessment as to whether or
23 not there is a duty of care.
24 That is why this principle has to be examined from
25 the perspective that Mr de Menezes was a suspected
165
1 suicide bomber. That is why we submit not only on all
2 of the principles that we have identified in the
3 authorities, but when one looks at the facts in this
4 case, it isn't possible to articulate what such a duty
5 of care would be.
6 That is as good a reason as any as we have
7 identified so far as to suggesting why there was not
8 a duty of care in this case.
9 Now, it's a topic that takes a lot of time because
10 it is such a complex topic, but we do submit that both
11 on legal principle and on the facts of this case, there
12 was not a duty of care owed to Mr de Menezes.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: At any stage?
14 MR HORWELL: At any stage.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What did it mean, then, when DAC Dick
16 said, "Stop him"?
17 MR HORWELL: When she said, "Stop him" --
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What she said and what a lot of other
19 officers said is: detain or arrest, arrest or detain.
20 MR HORWELL: As we have understood the evidence, there has
21 been no misunderstanding whatsoever, the words "stop
22 him" meant armed intervention.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Not worried about that for this
24 purpose, but what I think you may be saying is that on
25 your -- on the principles upon which you approach, and
166
1 indeed probably not even then, but the earliest point at
2 which a duty of care could have arisen is when they
3 actually detained him.
4 MR HORWELL: Yes.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: And not right up to that moment.
6 MR HORWELL: Yes, and that is based on authority.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Indeed on your argument, in this
8 context, not even then.
9 MR HORWELL: Not even the arrest would have introduced
10 a duty of care. The moment he was detained ...
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: We never got to that in this case,
12 I appreciate that.
13 MR HORWELL: That's right.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What you are putting to me is if they
15 had not fired, the duty of care only arises, never mind
16 the formalities of arrest, it's when they actually
17 physically detain him, when they get hold of him.
18 MR HORWELL: Yes, and that is firmly based on authority.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Arguably, Ivor had done it. This may
20 be a problem of the variety of angels dancing on the
21 head of a pin, but nevertheless, on the evidence Ivor
22 had done it.
23 MR HORWELL: An arrest is a continuing process. One cannot
24 divide arrest and detention in a matter of a moment.
25 The arrest of this man was what took place in that
167
1 carriage and detention hadn't even started.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, all right. I understand what you
3 say.
4 MR HORWELL: If one refers back to the authorities that we
5 have looked at, at some speed, it is a duty of care that
6 has been identified and defined as a duty to care for
7 the prisoner's welfare once in detention. And therefore
8 what cell do you put him in, what facilities do you give
9 him, suicide risk and so forth. That is the duty of
10 care that the police owe to a detainee.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: But on the analogy of the cases you
12 have already cited to me, and going right away from the
13 circumstances of this case, if an officer had been
14 ordered to pursue -- if an officer of the category of
15 Constable Laurent in the British Virgin Islands case,
16 had been sent off to detain Mr de Menezes, if you like,
17 on the suspicion that he is a suicide bomber, because of
18 Mr Laurent's unhappy tendencies to misuse firearms, the
19 act of negligence is dispatching him.
20 MR HORWELL: Yes, it's a completely different duty of care.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's the point.
22 MR HORWELL: If the operations room had knowingly and
23 deliberately used the most incompetent officers that
24 they could find, then that case and the duty identified
25 in that case would be manifest.
168
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I'm troubled by the concept of
2 a different duty of care. The duty of care is
3 universal. It's the question of how it's applied in any
4 given circumstances, isn't it?
5 MR HORWELL: The duty of care identified in that authority
6 is a duty to ensure that only proper and competent
7 police officers are given access to firearms. That is
8 a duty owed to the public at large. This is
9 a completely different circumstance.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Duty owed to an individual.
11 MR HORWELL: Yes.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: All right, yes.
13 MR HORWELL: It may even be earlier than that, that in that
14 Privy Council case, the duty identified by the
15 Privy Council was giving the firearm to the individual
16 in the first place, and so dispatching doesn't even come
17 into it. That is the duty that the police owe to the
18 public at large. These are wholly different
19 circumstances.
20 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I follow the distinction you are
21 drawing. Yes, very well.
22 MR HORWELL: Having spent so much time on the first part of
23 Adomako --
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: As you rightly say, it is the most
25 complex part.
169
1 MR HORWELL: I am going to deal with ingredients two to four
2 very quickly because of course Mr Perry will deal with
3 the detail tomorrow. I hope I don't do any injustice by
4 dealing with it so quickly --
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You will hear no complaints from me if
6 you and Mr Perry are sharing the burden.
7 MR HORWELL: We are, but I do believe I can deal with it
8 quickly because of the paucity of evidence that there is
9 in relation to ingredients 2, 3 and 4.
10 If there was a duty of care, Mr Mansfield has sought
11 to suggest that it arose at 4.55 in the morning when the
12 strategy was set. Well, that on any analysis is far too
13 early and far too remote, in our submission. The
14 strategy that Mr McDowall set was a fit and proper
15 strategy for these circumstances.
16 We would submit, starting with and looking at
17 McDowall, thereafter he remained too remote. The
18 criticisms continue. They appear to ignore the fact
19 that, on the evidence, Mr McDowall kept in touch with
20 what was happening, notwithstanding all of his other
21 responsibilities and duties that day, he kept in touch,
22 he had meetings, and he was kept informed.
23 We submit there is no evidence, and certainly
24 insufficient, that if there was a duty Mr McDowall
25 breached it. It simply isn't there.
170
1 Mr Esposito: too remote and far from such a duty, we
2 submit. His responsibility that day was to give advice.
3 There is no evidence whatsoever that the advice he gave
4 was defective. There is no evidence that he was not
5 keeping in contact with the firearms team, and when one
6 examines the critical moments as to whether or not CO19
7 could make the intervention, there is no evidence to
8 suggest that Mr Esposito was doing anything other than
9 passing on the information that he was receiving.
10 Again, no breach.
11 And in respect of Dick, who was leading the team in
12 the operations room, there is no evidence that she was
13 negligent in failing to be kept informed. She was in
14 the operations room and available for anyone to approach
15 and inform and, if there is fault, and I am not
16 suggesting that there was, in not informing her of
17 a development, it's not her responsibility. This idea
18 that senior police officers can be responsible
19 personally for every single part of a complex operation
20 such as this is not based on common sense.
21 Again, if we examine the critical moments, Dick's
22 reluctance to use SO12 is sound. The court has heard so
23 much evidence as to why CO19 were eminently to be
24 preferred. Again, I remind you, as we reminded
25 ourselves earlier today, as far as Dick was concerned,
171
1 once in eight years SO12 had been used to intervene.
2 That's a judgment call. That's not negligence. And
3 when she was told that CO19 could not make the
4 intervention, she was flexible enough to order SO12 to
5 intervene, and as we know, within moments she was told
6 CO19 were available and she countermanded her order.
7 It is quite wrong to approach the issue of fault
8 looking backwards. Each of these decisions has to be
9 examined at the time they were made, and in our
10 submission there is no evidence that Dick was at fault
11 and therefore breached any duty of care that she might
12 have owed. All of the authorities that we have cited --
13 on this occasion I am not obviously going to refer to
14 them -- all of those authorities about police officers
15 having to make split-second decisions and the sensible
16 manner in which the courts have to examine those
17 circumstances, there is no evidence here that she was at
18 fault.
19 Others might have done differently. That's not
20 negligence, never has been. These are the decisions
21 that an extremely experienced and competent police
22 officer made. Whatever one may say about them, they are
23 not negligent.
24 So we submit Adomako ground number two. There is no
25 breach even if there is a duty. We have set out in our
172
1 argument our submissions on causation, and perhaps the
2 most obvious criticism that has been made: why didn't
3 you get the firearms teams to the TA Centre at
4 an earlier stage? When you look at the evidence, that
5 was not causative of death.
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What, because they all got there by
7 half past nine?
8 MR HORWELL: Yes, they were there, and the evidence as we
9 have set out in our written submissions, the evidence of
10 Dick and Boutcher that the location of CO19 made no
11 difference to the decisions that were made. There is
12 an expectation that firearms officers will be where they
13 are told to be --
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: If you have to narrow it down,
15 I suppose, to the closest point at which something went
16 wrong, it would be, I suppose, the fact that for
17 whatever reason DAC Dick was not aware that -- was not
18 made aware that Mr de Menezes had left the house until
19 he had passed the potential pinch point, if you like, at
20 the TA Centre, by which time of course it was too late.
21 MR HORWELL: If that was a fault, it is not the fault of
22 Dick.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's what I mean, it's a failure of
24 execution or a failure of -- yes, failure of execution
25 of McDowall's instructions, in the sense that the person
173
1 who was in a position to order the intervention wasn't
2 given the necessary information until it was too late.
3 Yes?
4 MR HORWELL: Yes. If an fault --
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That may well be something from
6 a narrative verdict, it may well be, I don't know,
7 I want to ask you about that in a moment, but not on any
8 view a matter within DAC Dick's --
9 MR HORWELL: Certainly not --
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: -- or Esposito or McDowall.
11 MR HORWELL: We agree, but as you have raised that point on
12 the evidence, it comes back to where we started these
13 submissions this afternoon, namely you cannot order
14 an armed intervention until a certain threshold of
15 identification has been reached.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: But I am not actually trying to be
17 contentious.
18 MR HORWELL: I know you are not.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: From the point of view of gross
20 negligence, manslaughter, in one sense it's a complete
21 answer on this particular narrow aspect of the case.
22 MR HORWELL: Yes.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: On the other hand, from the point of
24 view of the questions left to the jury for a narrative
25 verdict, the existence or otherwise of a duty of care
174
1 and the degree of negligence, if any, that may have led
2 -- it doesn't much matter. It's a question of the jury
3 disposing of or dealing with the central factual issues
4 in the case. Was it an error, was it a mistake,
5 whatever you like to call it, was it a lost opportunity,
6 which is the most appropriate phrase to be used in
7 a narrative verdict of this kind. That is still open to
8 them.
9 MR HORWELL: Potentially, yes. I would prefer to deal with
10 that as a separate point tomorrow afternoon.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You can. I am only simply illustrating
12 that there are other questions to be asked about that.
13 MR HORWELL: Certainly as a principle that is right, of
14 course it is. If we simply look at the issue of gross
15 negligence/manslaughter as set out by the family --
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Then I have your point on that.
17 MR HORWELL: -- then it does not arise, and that's what for
18 the moment we have an interest in. I really can be
19 brief on ground number four. Even if we were to fail on
20 everything else, how on earth, your having seen, the
21 jury having seen the quality and the dedication and the
22 experience and the competence of these police officers,
23 how on earth can their decisions, their judgment calls,
24 be said to be "criminal", "wicked", "heinous", and so
25 forth.
175
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, you have embarked on an exercise
2 I was about to ask you to take on, to give me
3 an anthology of the epithets that have been applied in
4 order to justify the finding of gross. I know atrocious
5 is one of them. Repeat what you have just said.
6 MR HORWELL: We have set them out at some length. But
7 "criminal", "wicked", "truly exceptionally bad",
8 "heinous", "properly condemned as criminal".
9 We get nowhere near, on the evidence.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What do you say about the fact that it
11 is said in Adomako that it is a matter supremely for the
12 jury?
13 MR HORWELL: Everything in a criminal case is supremely
14 a matter for the jury. That does not absolve the judge
15 of the responsibility of deciding whether there is
16 sufficient evidence for the jury to consider that point.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Am I not taking a subjective judgment
18 as to what I think it is?
19 MR HORWELL: No. You are taking an objective look at the
20 evidence, as every judge does in a criminal case at the
21 close of the prosecution case.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, this isn't Galbraith, is it?
23 Not in that sense. This is an assessment of the --
24 well, I suppose it is Galbraith in a sense, it's
25 a question of looking at the evidence to say even if all
176
1 that is true, does it objectively viewed amount to what
2 the case law says has to be shown?
3 MR HORWELL: Yes.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It's not quite Galbraith because
5 Galbraith hugely depends on the belief or disbelief in
6 the evidence.
7 MR HORWELL: Yes, but you perform the function that any
8 criminal judge would perform at this stage of deciding
9 whether there is sufficient evidence on an ingredient of
10 an offence, to go before a jury for a jury to decide so
11 that they are sure that that ingredient has been proved.
12 And all that is meant, we would submit, in Adomako, that
13 of course it's supremely a matter for the jury.
14 Dishonesty in a shoplifting case is supremely a matter
15 for the jury, but if the judge doesn't find enough
16 evidence, he withdraws it.
17 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I know. I'm just perceiving
18 a distinction. So often Galbraith is a question of
19 the tenuousness or otherwise of the evidence. Here we
20 are not worried about the tenuousness of the evidence.
21 We are looking at the evidence square on and saying what
22 does it come to. Yes?
23 MR HORWELL: Yes.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: If you like, as a matter of policy,
25 I am exercising a filter, as a matter of the proper use
177
1 of words.
2 MR HORWELL: Yes, and again to quote some of the authorities
3 that have been cited, if a Coroner were to decide that,
4 if a jury were to return a finding to the criminal
5 standard on a particular ingredient of an offence, if
6 a Coroner were to find that such a finding would be
7 perverse, we submit that, as he would have to under
8 Galbraith, whatever the test he was applying, the
9 Coroner would be under a positive duty to ensure that
10 that matter was not left.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It should be the other way around. If
12 the Coroner decided to leave such matters to a jury on
13 the basis that they could give rise to a verdict of what
14 in effect would be gross negligence/manslaughter, then
15 it's capable of being reviewed. The decision to leave
16 it.
17 MR HORWELL: Yes. It would be, because it doesn't matter
18 what the ingredient is, it has to pass the test, the
19 evidential test, and the element of grossness is
20 an ingredient of the offence, like any other ingredient
21 of any other offence, and the judge or the Coroner has
22 to decide is there sufficient evidence for that
23 ingredient to be left to a jury. So in that sense there
24 is nothing unusual about the element of grossness, it's
25 simply another ingredient of another offence, and in our
178
1 submission when you look at it objectively, the evidence
2 comes nowhere near.
3 And those are our submissions.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Thank you very much, Mr Horwell, your
5 timing is impeccable. We will have another ten minutes.
6 We will go to quarter to. Mr Stern, you are a very long
7 way back. Would you find it easier and more convenient
8 if I asked you to move up?
9 MR STERN: Not at all, if it would be more convenient for
10 you, sir.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I am thinking of you.
12 MR STERN: I am fine where I am.
13 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What I am going to suggest, if
14 Mr Horwell and others don't mind, if anybody wants to
15 come up from the back row for the purpose of making
16 submissions, I would be more than happy. You have ten
17 minutes to do a bit of moving around if you would like
18 to. If you prefer to do it from the front row, please
19 do.
20 MR STERN: I am perfectly okay here.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Up to you. All right, ten to.
22 (3.40 pm)
23 (A short break)
24 (3.50 pm)

179
1 Submissions by MR STERN
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, Mr Stern.
3 MR STERN: Sir, we make three submissions on behalf of C2
4 and C12.
5 The first is that there is no evidence or no
6 sufficient evidence to leave unlawful killing to the
7 jury. The second is that there is sufficient evidence
8 and the jury ought to be left with the two potential
9 verdicts, lawful killing and open verdict, in short form
10 in relation to the firearms officers and the shots that
11 were fired.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: For lawful and open? The second of
13 those sounds like a contradiction in terms.
14 MR STERN: Well --
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: If you have sufficient evidence for
16 an open verdict.
17 MR STERN: I understand that, but it's one that ought to be
18 left.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, all right.
20 MR STERN: The third submission is that, dependent on the
21 above, obviously, there are no narrative questions that
22 are required for the actions on the carriage as they are
23 subsumed within the short-form verdict.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I see that, yes. No basis for
25 a narrative question?
180
1 MR STERN: No basis, yes. I make no submissions about
2 narratives in relation to the command team and other
3 aspects.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I understand that.
5 MR STERN: In relation to unlawful killing, there is
6 a single issue. That is the issue of honest belief.
7 I think, sir, you said that it was conceded.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Honest belief about his identity.
9 MR STERN: Exactly, I just wanted to clarify that.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's what I meant, about his identity
11 as being one of the previous day's attempted suicide
12 bombers.
13 MR STERN: Exactly. Can I just stand back, as it were, from
14 the detail of the evidence, because obviously we have
15 heard a lot of it, and you have, I hope, had
16 an opportunity of looking at the submissions that we
17 have made, and indeed the fairly detailed references.
18 What you are concerned with in relation to these two
19 firearms officers is a five to ten-second fast-moving
20 and dynamic incident on the carriage of
21 a London Underground train.
22 They were put as Trojan 84 described it or assessed
23 it, as being an outrageous position.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Do you also agree with Mr Horwell that
25 what he was talking about was the danger into which
181
1 these officers were put?
2 MR STERN: I do.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Or perceived danger, I should say.
4 MR STERN: All of this is obviously on the basis of
5 perceived danger. He had said:
6 "It was a crying shame in all of this, you know. We
7 released 2 and 12 into an impossible situation where
8 they had to make sense, because of the individual
9 officer responsibility, they were given the judgment
10 call and that is unbelievably outrageous that they
11 should be left with that responsibility."
12 They had to stop what is accepted that they believed
13 to be a suicide bomber who, the very day before, had
14 sought to commit mass murder in the very same type of
15 location. As Lord Justice Richards said in Da Silva,
16 paragraph 46:
17 "Once it's accepted that they honestly and genuinely
18 believed that they were confronted by a real suicide
19 bomber, then the only realistic judgment of their
20 actions could be that they acted in the highest degree
21 of courage in advancing towards him and doing what they
22 did."
23 Clearly that may be that that included not just him
24 being identified as a suicide bomber, but obviously
25 believing that he --
182
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The second limb.
2 MR STERN: The second limb. I come back in this overview to
3 the very point that you made, sir, during the course of
4 the final moments of my learned friend's submissions
5 that if they did not honestly believe that their lives
6 and the lives of the public were in imminent peril, then
7 why did they shoot this man? It does not make sense.
8 There is no basis for suggesting any alternative course
9 that was in their minds.
10 Now, of course its right that motive is only part
11 and parcel, but where you have here an express decision
12 by the officers as to the reason why it is that they
13 fired shots, then there must be some basis for
14 undermining that and some alternative explanation put
15 forward. In my submission, there doesn't even begin to
16 be one here.
17 The points relied on by my learned friend today and
18 obviously I take into account his written submissions,
19 but we submit that these points, individually and
20 cumulatively, could not begin to satisfy the Galbraith
21 test of sufficiency for murder. They are essentially
22 several isolated factors that do not rebut honest
23 belief, and in any event, they ignore the cumulative
24 weight of the evidence that C2 and C12 had every reason
25 to form the honest belief that they did form.
183
1 The two aspects that were relied on in the Court of
2 Appeal, the bulky jacket and the "armed police", I hope
3 I can just paraphrase them in that way, neither of
4 those, in our submission, constituted even prima facie
5 evidence that the officers had lied --
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Well, the bulky jacket does seem to
7 have taken a bit of a back seat lately.
8 MR STERN: I was just going to say I am not going to address
9 you any further on that because of the submissions that
10 have, in my submission appropriately, been adopted by my
11 learned friend Mr Mansfield today unless you wish me to.
12 They are in our documents, they are in our submissions
13 but I was not going to say any more about them.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You have the additional factor that one
15 of the civilian witnesses whose name has now escaped me,
16 Preston, thought that Ivor's similar denim jacket had
17 a bulky appearance.
18 MR STERN: That's Whitby. Whitby and Preston, there are two
19 of them in fact, and they are both set out in our
20 submissions document.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Now of course we have the evidence of
22 the officers themselves as to how it appeared to them --
23 MR STERN: Exactly, and in any event they were split second
24 or snapshot views by them.
25 Hopefully I can put that to one side, which leaves
184
1 really the issue of the "armed police", as Mr Mansfield
2 calls it, the cameo or scenario, and the issue of
3 confrontation which he has not enlarged upon today but
4 is within his document.
5 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
6 MR STERN: One of the ways in which Mr Mansfield put the
7 matter to C12, and this is -- I'll just give you the
8 reference and read it because it's a very short part,
9 27 October, page 133, line 15:
10 "Question: Do you think there is a possibility
11 that, as you quite rightly say and I accept this, and
12 I have given you the opportunity, as a human being you
13 allowed fear to take over that day?
14 "Answer: Fear was certainly present, but as regards
15 controlling my actions, it possibly had some effect,
16 yes. I can't deny that. You are asking me to recall
17 exactly what I felt. I felt I was going to die,
18 certainly, and I took action in order to stop that.
19 "Question: In other words, is there a possibility
20 that because of the fear you felt, even that, that
21 actually you weren't in control of assessment and your
22 actions, the two things?
23 "Answer: No.
24 "Question: No?
25 "Answer: Not at all, sir."
185
1 Fear does not negate honest belief. It is a --
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It may be an explanation for it.
3 MR STERN: It may be a consequence of it.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: No, it may be an explanation for it.
5 MR STERN: Whichever way you analyse the actions as set down
6 by these officers, on whichever basis, there is no
7 evidence to rebut honest belief. Even if there was
8 a Kratos order, which there wasn't in this case and
9 no-one suggests there was, that would still be an honest
10 belief. Even if there was no challenge, there would
11 still be an honest belief.
12 Sir, I want to look at the submissions document that
13 we have prepared, beginning at page 9. I am not going
14 to go through it all, but if I may I will just go
15 through various parts of it, and highlights, as it were,
16 in relation to the points that have been made in the
17 document indeed by Mr Mansfield today.
18 Looking at the point that Mr Mansfield relies upon,
19 the highest that this matter can be put forward is this:
20 that even if the officers have lied, which is not
21 accepted, that, as Mr Hilliard put in his submissions at
22 paragraph 33(iii), that would not logically prove that
23 there was no genuine belief in a threat any lie might
24 have been to bolster lethal action taken in the genuine
25 belief that there was a threat, and there is a reference
186
1 there to Sharman, paragraph 42, which is set out in our
2 document.
3 If you want to look at the full context of that --
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Of course the Divisional Court had it
5 in mind that there are a lot of other explanations for
6 lies.
7 MR STERN: Exactly.
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Of which the most obvious one might be
9 that in the awful consciousness that a man had been
10 killed, that both of them might be aware that they had
11 not actually followed black letter requirements of the
12 ACPO guidance. If they had not.
13 MR STERN: Yes. Exactly. And the quote is set out more
14 fully at page 26 in our skeleton argument for your
15 reference.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
17 MR STERN: In the middle, paragraph 42 is quoted:
18 "Making every assumption against the officers that
19 Mr Owen seeks and discounting (whether correctly or not)
20 the problems of perceptual distortion suggested by
21 Mr Bentley, it is equally plausible that, having
22 honestly believed that they were under imminent threat
23 of being shot, when they discovered that [he] had no
24 more than a table leg, they then panicked and felt that
25 their true recollections would not be believed."
187
1 That's the point you, sir, were just making.
2 "The finding (even if correct) of subsequent
3 dishonest fabrication does not exclude it and, given all
4 the circumstances, it does not appear to me that there
5 is any basis for being able to rebut that possibility
6 beyond reasonable doubt."
7 Mr Hilliard considered that there were three issues
8 emerging from Mr Mansfield's skeleton argument that
9 merited detailed consideration. There are only two that
10 remain. The first he has set out at paragraph 33,
11 page 21, and I adopt the arguments and the submissions
12 that he has set out there in their entirety, numbers 1
13 to 4.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes. Well, this is a reflection of the
15 appendix of Da Silva to a very large extent.
16 MR STERN: Yes, but they are the points that he makes and
17 I rely on them.
18 Insofar as this aspect is concerned, that first
19 argument, the "armed police" cameo scenario, we have
20 dealt with it at paragraph 11, which is page 21. The
21 first point in relation to this is that there is
22 evidence, safe evidence, that each of the constituent
23 elements of that cameo are in fact supported by other
24 evidence in the case.
25 The "armed police" or "police" is heard by a number
188
1 of witnesses and we have set them out at paragraph 12.
2 Ivor heard shouting throughout the incident. Most
3 importantly, Ivor hears the word "police" after the
4 shouts of "he's here" but before he grabs Mr de Menezes.
5 So in our submission that is entirely consistent with
6 C12's account.
7 You have the references there, and I can take you to
8 them if you wish, but again I was not proposing to take
9 you to each of these references.
10 Geoff. He said that there was a noise within which
11 he heard the word "police". It was audible to him. He
12 said it was outside the carriage but very, very quickly
13 outside became inside, which is why I have started with
14 you are talking about an incident that is seconds, and
15 therefore when you look at what Ivor said and when you
16 look at what Geoff said, they are both, in our
17 submission, consistent with what C12 said.
18 Sir, I'll just refer to you Terry, if I may. I have
19 got the reference there, as you can see, and it begins
20 in this way:
21 "So the order in which you put it in your statement
22 is that there are shouts of 'Police' and 'Armed police'
23 prior to you shouting 'Armed police'?
24 "Answer: Yes.
25 "Question: Is that the order in which you recall it
189
1 now?
2 "Answer: Yes.
3 "Question: Familiar voices shouting those
4 instructions, I presume you didn't know anybody on the
5 tube?
6 "Answer: That's correct, sir.
7 "Question: So when you say 'familiar voices', do
8 you mean the voices of those police officers who were on
9 your team?
10 "Answer: Yes.
11 So that certainly narrows that down as to who it was
12 who was shouting it. Over the page, page 174:
13 "Obviously at the time and you have put it in your
14 statement, you were only really aware of C2's presence
15 as I understand it?
16 "Answer: No, I was aware of other officers being
17 present, but I was focused on C2, because he was so
18 close to me."
19 Then at line 19:
20 "I see. Those shouts that you heard, or challenges
21 of 'Police' and 'Armed police', were before you got on
22 to the carriage?
23 "Answer: Yes.
24 Then he says:
25 "If you follow the next sentence, you will see,
190
1 because your call was as you came on to the carriage?
2 "Answer: Yes.
3 "Question: That's correct, is it?
4 "Answer: Yes, sir.
5 Then over the page at 176, line 8, having put it in
6 its background context:
7 "Just while we are on that point of time, the way
8 your statement is set out, Mr Stern's taken the first
9 two steps, it's the third step I want to look at, you
10 heard the familiar voices shouting various things such
11 as 'Police' or 'Armed police'.
12 "Answer: Yes, sir.
13 "Sir Michael Wright: You have told Mr Stern that
14 your call came after that.
15 "Answer: Yes.
16 "Sir Michael Wright: As you stepped into the
17 carriage. The next thing that you set out in your
18 statement is hearing the cracking noises. Do you see
19 that?
20 "Answer: Yes.
21 "Sir Michael Wright: Which I take it you are
22 referring to the shots?
23 "Answer: Yes, sir.
24 "Sir Michael Wright: Again, I fully understand that
25 all this happened at top speed, very, very, very quick,
191
1 but to the best of your ability, is that the order in
2 which those three things happened?
3 "Answer: It is the -- to the best of my ability,
4 the order."
5 So again there is, in our submission, a consistency
6 of the evidence.
7 So far as Terri Godley is concerned, she heard
8 "armed police" on the platform before the shots.
9 Then Robert Lowe, on 4 November at page 30, line 19.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Everybody heard shouting of some kind.
11 MR STERN: Quite.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Or pretty well everybody.
13 MR STERN: Yes.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The civilian witnesses I think are as
15 one in saying they didn't hear "armed police".
16 Terri Godley said "police".
17 MR STERN: I think she said "armed police".
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: We can look it up.
19 MR STERN: Yes. That is correct. That is the position.
20 But there doesn't have to be a distinction between
21 police officers and civilians. One can't work on the
22 basis that all police officers are lying and all
23 civilians are telling the truth.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Depends how cynical you are being,
25 Mr Stern.
192
1 MR STERN: Well, I am not cynical as those who know me know.
2 But the position in relation to police officers is
3 that it's inevitable that police officers are going to
4 be more finely tuned to the sounds of "armed police",
5 because clearly they are -- that is the sound that will
6 obviously attract their attention to some incident being
7 taken to another level, whereas civilians may
8 concentrate on a variety of things.
9 If it were that all the civilians spoke with one
10 voice about all matters, then that may be something that
11 one could rely on, but that isn't the position.
12 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That would be an all-time first.
13 MR STERN: Quite, because not all the police officers hear
14 "armed police". Even C2 does not hear C12's shout of
15 "armed police".
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You are getting perilously close to the
17 concept of collaborative notebooks, which I don't think
18 we want to go into at this stage.
19 MR STERN: Precisely, that's exactly it, they don't have the
20 same note.
21 Anna Dunwoodie described shouting as well. So
22 that's the police or the --
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Almost to a man or woman they say there
24 was shouting.
25 MR STERN: Exactly.
193
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The only issues -- the only point on
2 which the police witnesses and civilian witnesses divide
3 is the content of the shout. A lot of people say "get
4 down" or "get out", but that's as far as it goes.
5 MR STERN: Yes, I think some say "get in".
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: One says "get in", yes.
7 MR STERN: But that aspect of the evidence of C12 is
8 supported, in my submission, by numerous other witnesses
9 and because witnesses can't say what those shouts were,
10 that doesn't mean to say that you can reject it.
11 The second aspect, the gun up, there is in fact
12 another witness who sees that, Ralph Livock, I have set
13 it out at paragraph 13. He has the man entering the
14 carriage carrying a pistol, levelled at the man sitting
15 opposite Rachel Wilson. We know that's Mr de Menezes.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, the distinction there is that he
17 says it's up by the time he comes into the carriage,
18 Charlie 12 said he had been holding it down by his leg
19 until virtually the last moment when he brought it up.
20 MR STERN: Yes, he brought it up when he was on the
21 carriage, yes.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Here again you have wide variations in
23 the civilian recollection, including at one stage
24 bullets in the ceiling, and I can't remember who it was,
25 one of the ladies, I think, who said, "I actually
194
1 thought he was shot by two men with rifles".
2 MR STERN: Yes, there is somebody who says that and somebody
3 says he was shot on the floor by two men --
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Five shots on the floor.
5 MR STERN: The point is not new to the courts, as I set out
6 at paragraph 15. Mr Justice Leveson in Sharman said:
7 "... it is commonplace that in sudden unexpected
8 incidents, different people focus on different
9 things..."
10 Indeed Lord Bingham, Lord Chief Justice, set it out
11 in Bentley in more fulsome terms, and I know that you
12 have looked at those.
13 So bearing in mind all of those comments and the
14 evidence as we have looked at it there, the omission of
15 a reference to a particular act or word spoken cannot
16 amount to a safe evidence that the act did not take
17 place or the word was not spoken.
18 Then the examples are set out there fully at
19 paragraph 16, and I won't go through all of those.
20 At paragraph 17 there are witnesses who, as you say,
21 positively assert various things, and again they are
22 wrong about that.
23 So those are the matters in relation to the "armed
24 police" point. Even if it were not said, then, as
25 I said at the outset, that would not amount to
195
1 a rebuttal of an honest belief for the reasons that
2 I have already gone through.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Is it sufficient evidence to leave to
4 a jury?
5 MR STERN: No.
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Why not?
7 MR STERN: What, the "armed police"?
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes. If there is room for
9 a conclusion, however cynical it may sound, that the
10 police officers are now, possibly with the support of
11 their colleagues, claiming to have uttered the warning
12 of "armed police", to use the old Lucas definition,
13 because of a sense of guilt at what they had done, why
14 isn't that something that a jury is entitled to
15 consider?
16 MR STERN: There is no evidence to rebut honest belief. You
17 cannot look and say: well, there may be a lie in
18 relation to "armed police" and therefore that rebuts
19 honest belief. You have to look at the evidence
20 overall.
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Mr Mansfield says it's indicative of
22 the fact that they were in a mindset that they were
23 going to shoot this chap before they ever got on the
24 platform.
25 MR STERN: But that is not the evidence. That is not the
196
1 evidence at all. Not only is it not the evidence of C12
2 and C2, it is not the evidence of the other firearms
3 officers, and there is no evidence that these officers,
4 that is to say those who say they heard "armed police",
5 have conspired together and have decided to put in their
6 statements this particular aspect of the evidence.
7 There is no evidence of that.
8 So one has to look at the concrete evidence, not
9 just at whether on one interpretation, for which there
10 is no evidence of itself, they could come to the
11 conclusion it is a lie. A lie about an immaterial
12 aspect of the case might, might be supportive evidence
13 if there were evidence, is I think the way Lord
14 Justice Richards put it in Da Silva. It might be
15 supportive of a charge if indeed there were sufficient
16 evidence in the first place, but there isn't in this
17 hearing or case at all.
18 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, very well.
19 MR STERN: The second aspect is set out at Mr Hilliard's
20 skeleton argument at page 22. The bulky jacket, I will
21 pass over that. The third argument, paragraph 35,
22 page 22, the manner of the confrontation.
23 Mr Mansfield's not dealt with any of this in further
24 argument today, but he has set it out in his skeleton
25 argument, and the points are summarised helpfully by
197
1 Mr Hilliard in his skeleton argument there at page 22.
2 I adopt all of the points that he makes, again,
3 between paragraph 35(i) and 35(v).
4 Indeed, if one looks at paragraph 36 of his skeleton
5 argument, he also makes it clear that the annex to the
6 Da Silva judgment, 17 and A19, they tend to support the
7 arguments of C2 and C12 on those points, although the
8 full evidence of the civilian witnesses was not before
9 the director and the court at the time.
10 Mr Horwell has addressed you in relation to the
11 civilian witnesses, and indeed in relation to the fact
12 that, although those witnesses had not been heard, the
13 statements had been seen, and indeed their evidence has
14 not differed to any marked extent.
15 Sir, we deal with this aspect in our submissions
16 beginning at page 14.
17 At the top of the page, (g) and (h) deal with the
18 movement by Mr de Menezes out of his seat. Now, when
19 Ivor gave evidence of this, I don't believe there was
20 any challenge to his evidence, and there is other
21 evidence that supports that. You will remember the
22 evidence of Mr Tomei that the distribution of blood and
23 indeed the way in which the shots were fired were
24 entirely consistent with Ivor having held Mr de Menezes.
25 The point about that is that it is obviously clear
198
1 that he must have got out of his seat in order for Ivor
2 to have got him in a bear hug. So there is support for
3 that. There is Ivor's evidence, there is D9's evidence,
4 there is Ken's evidence, there is a range of evidence,
5 and it's quite clear, as I say, that Ivor described him
6 as agitated when he got up, and that he advanced towards
7 the officers. This is an important piece of evidence
8 for which there is no evidence to rebut it. But
9 interestingly, none of the civilian witnesses see it,
10 and it was not suggested, and has not been suggested as
11 I understand it, that Ivor has lied or that D9 has lied
12 or Ken has lied.
13 So it is, again, an important illustration of the
14 fact that, despite civilians being present and not
15 seeing parts of the evidence, nevertheless it is
16 unquestionably accurate.
17 So we submit that in relation to that evidence, it
18 is an obvious inference that the officers could draw,
19 was that this identified suicide bomber was advancing
20 towards a threat with a gun, forget about "armed police"
21 for the moment, but even holding a gun in the way
22 described by Mr Livock, and the obvious inference is
23 that he was moving towards them because he had the
24 means, the will and the ability to deal with or overcome
25 that threat.
199
1 That is his action, which is described very fully by
2 those witnesses, and again I won't take you to the
3 transcript but I know you have it well in mind. But it
4 doesn't end there because there is then this rather
5 strange movement or unusual movement of his hands. That
6 again is described at page 14, letter (j).
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's Mr Livock again, isn't it?
8 MR STERN: Well, it's Ivor, Mr Livock, D9, Ken.
9 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I beg your pardon, forgive me, we were
10 at cross-purposes. There is one specific movement of
11 his hand which is spoken to by Mr Livock and nobody
12 else.
13 MR STERN: Yes, that may well be: suspect's hands towards
14 the left-hand side of his trouser waistband. Seconds
15 before the -- hearing the shots were fired.
16 That is the position. But in any event, the
17 perception of the hands is obviously difficult to be
18 accurate about.
19 But one thing all of the witnesses are clear about
20 is that there was something unusual about it. There was
21 something not quite right. I think one of them
22 described him as not using the armrest when he got out
23 of his seat. But that was their interpretation,
24 obviously, at the time. That was their perception.
25 So that of course is a very significant factor in
200
1 the minds of the officers, C2 and C12, and indeed all
2 those others who were present.
3 Indeed, if you look, and we have set it out at
4 page 15, letter (j), that there were a host of other
5 officers who also interpreted the suspect's act as
6 threatening. So we are not in a position here where C2
7 and C12 are isolated in their perception of the threat.
8 There is practically no difference between the
9 perception of Ivor and C2 and C12, and for Ivor's
10 actions he was commended, as you know, and C2 and C12
11 acted on the perception that they had with the same
12 bravery.
13 Set out Ivor there at page 15. Over the page, D9.
14 He believed that the suspect did have or might have
15 a bomb on him and thought that he was going to detonate
16 it. Incidentally, I should just mention this: D9 did
17 not see Ivor move in the way described. Ken, he took
18 the suspect's actions to mean that he was non-compliant,
19 that he was a threat, and he feared for the suspect's
20 safety. You will remember that Ken believed that the
21 police had actually challenged, that was the way he put
22 it, that there had been a challenge by the police to
23 Mr de Menezes, and that is why he feared for his safety,
24 because of his reaction in relation to that challenge.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: It was D9, as I remember it, who was
201
1 actually coming down the carriage when all this
2 happened.
3 MR STERN: Yes.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: And he actually thought, when he heard
5 the shots, a bomb was about to go off, if I remember.
6 Am I right?
7 MR STERN: Yes. He was --
8 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: He said he tensed up because he thought
9 there was going to be an explosion.
10 MR STERN: C5 -- I'm sorry -- I am told. I thought it was
11 D9 but it's C5. Thank you very much.
12 There were a number of them who feared that they
13 were not going to be going home that evening. I think
14 Ralph made that clear, he said as he was coming down the
15 stairs.
16 Indeed, at letter (k), there are some extracts from
17 some of the witnesses who were in that position and
18 acutely aware of the significant potential threat.
19 Indeed, Ralph:
20 "... there was no doubt in my mind that this man was
21 a suicide bomber and that there was a real possibility
22 that he was in possession of a explosive device which he
23 could detonate to the serious danger of the public and
24 the officers from my team. I firmly believed I may have
25 to shoot him dead in order to prevent this."
202
1 C5:
2 "... I had this vision in my mind that if I don't
3 get on that train, something terrible could happen and
4 I will be left on the platform and there would be or
5 possibly be an explosion in the tunnel further up. And
6 I didn't want that to happen. I moved onto the train
7 ..."
8 Which was remarkably brave, you may think, bearing
9 in mind his state of mind.
10 "... onto that carriage via the small door to the
11 left. You can't see it in the picture ..."
12 Terry. Terry deals with the position even after he
13 can see that Mr de Menezes is clearly no longer a live
14 threat. He said:
15 "I was very, very concerned at that point that there
16 was still the possibility of this individual wearing
17 a concealed explosive device and, despite what had
18 happened and what I could see, I was still very
19 concerned about the possibility of that device
20 detonating."
21 Then Ken likewise, when you put to him, sir, the
22 point that I had put to him about whether he was brave
23 or not, and he said that he was, in his opinion:
24 "... a possible for the subject, and therefore I did
25 believe he was a potential threat ..."
203
1 Of course so far as Ken is concerned one has to look
2 at it in this way: that Ken was not of the view that he
3 was positively identified as a suicide bomber from the
4 day before, because he is a surveillance officer and
5 therefore had a lower threshold of identification.
6 So all of those together, one has to look at the
7 evidence as a whole, and look at the position in
8 relation to these witnesses, and what it is that they
9 thought.
10 Can I turn to page 18, please, in the submissions.
11 18(m) and (n). It is a point that you may think is of
12 some significance that both C12 and C2 separately and
13 independently arrived at the same belief as to the level
14 of threat posed and it was necessary to discharge their
15 weapon in order to protect themselves and the public.
16 These are both, as you know, extremely experienced
17 specialist firearms officers and both instructors, both
18 having been with the specialist firearms officers for
19 some years.
20 So each individually came to that conclusion, that
21 it was necessary to do what they did.
22 At letter (n), I don't know if I need to deal with
23 this, because the shots that were fired, the number of
24 them, it's really I think an extension of the point that
25 you were making, sir, perhaps earlier about what could
204
1 be the reason, that the shots in many ways are, both the
2 location of the shots and indeed the number of the
3 shots, is compelling evidence to suggest that both
4 officers genuinely believed that they were facing
5 an immediate threat.
6 Then again after the incident of the shooting, C12
7 shouted, "Bomb, everyone get" out". C2, he pulled
8 someone back and shouted, "Move back", and he went out
9 of the doorway himself.
10 So it's quite clear, both before, during and after
11 that they had a clear and honest belief that this man
12 was about to detonate a bomb, and could still have
13 a bomb detonated by a variety of means that we have
14 heard about from Mr Swain, the switch method, underneath
15 the clothing, without even noticing that somebody was
16 doing that.
17 Indeed, if you have got even the toggle, I think in
18 your hand, it's like a car switch, I think, as Mr Swain
19 described it, you can brush that against your leg and
20 that will move the switch in the direction that the
21 suicide bomber would wish to.
22 Sir, the evidence at page 19, letter (p), and it's
23 an extract, I won't read it out but you will remember it
24 very well, I am sure. It's the point at which C12
25 became emotionally upset.
205
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes.
2 MR STERN: It's when they were in the passageway after the
3 incident and they were looking at each other because
4 they had heard gunshots, not being clear where they had
5 come from, or they had heard bangs and they were not
6 sure whether it was a detonated bomb, gunshots or what
7 it was, and that they were actually concerned that they
8 themselves had been actually injured or that the blood
9 was coming from them.
10 Again, was that all a show or did they honestly
11 believe that unfortunately this suspect was a suicide
12 bomber?
13 Can I invite you, please, now to page 28, (d).
14 There is the evidence of others, both Ivor, Ken and
15 Terry, of what's described as the struggle that takes
16 place during this extremely rapid movement, and that
17 there was a feeling that the struggle continued even
18 after shots were fire. Whether that was illusory or
19 not, it was of course something that others noticed.
20 The shots, this is at letter (e), were all fired
21 within seconds. I know in Mr Mansfield's submissions
22 there is a reference to Mr Whitby, who stands alone
23 I think in saying that one of the shots or some of the
24 shots were 30 seconds later.
25 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: He was halfway up the escalator,
206
1 helping the lady.
2 MR STERN: Exactly. So the overwhelming body of evidence is
3 that these shots were seconds, and I'll move on from
4 that.
5 The clearing of the stovepipe stoppage, that's
6 a point again made in Mr Mansfield's skeleton. Again
7 there is clear evidence from C5 that that would have
8 been done within a fraction of a second, so again we are
9 not talking about long periods of time.
10 Page 29, please. And again I do not propose to go
11 through this in any detail but what it sets out there is
12 the restraint that was made of Mr de Menezes by Ivor and
13 what D9's view was and where he thought the hands were
14 and what it was that he was doing in relation to that.
15 Sir, those are the submissions on the facts. As
16 I say, when you look at it, that is the only aspect that
17 Mr Mansfield relies on, those two aspects now, "armed
18 police" scenario, and there is both evidence that it's
19 accurate and it is, and even if it's not, in my
20 submission it doesn't rebut honest belief. The
21 confrontation I have dealt with, and I rely, as I say,
22 and adopt those arguments advanced on behalf of
23 the Commissioner by my learned friend Mr Horwell and
24 those points raised by Mr Hilliard in his submissions as
25 well.
207
1 So those are my submissions, that there is clearly,
2 and overwhelmingly clearly, no evidence or insufficient
3 evidence to leave unlawful killing to the jury.
4 Would you wish me to deal with either any other
5 aspect or --
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I think I want you, rather than coming
7 back to it later, have you had a chance to look at
8 Mr Mansfield's four-page summary?
9 MR STERN: Very briefly this morning, yes.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: There are, I think in relation to that
11 which particularly impacts on your two clients, are the
12 four factual questions.
13 MR STERN: That's it.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What you were saying to me earlier on,
15 admittedly it's not really susceptible of enormously
16 extended submission, but what you said, there is no
17 basis for inviting the jury to leave narrative verdicts
18 in relation to the events in the carriage.
19 There are the four suggestions that come from the
20 family. What do you say about it?
21 MR STERN: Well, I think there are five, actually. First of
22 all they are not contributory factors, they are factual
23 questions.
24 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That's right, they are direct factors.
25 MR STERN: Yes. Well, as I understand the basis upon which
208
1 you were going to leave any narrative questions, they
2 must be relevant and causative.
3 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Certainly.
4 MR STERN: That's the first point. The second is this: if
5 they are --
6 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Aren't these relevant and causative?
7 MR STERN: Well, they are subsumed, they could be, yes, some
8 of them could be, but they are subsumed within the
9 short-form verdict of lawful killing or open.
10 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I do not want you to be under any
11 misapprehension. I repeat what I said to Mr Horwell
12 that I am certainly not going to make up my mind, as it
13 were, on the hoof as to whether I think I should or
14 should not. You are quite right in the sense that if
15 I were to leave the short-form verdict of unlawful
16 killing in relation to C2 and C12, a verdict on that
17 would answer these questions.
18 But on the assumption that I do not, what do you say
19 about the factual questions that are being suggested
20 there?
21 MR STERN: No, what I am submitting is that if you left
22 a verdict of lawful killing, then it would be subsumed
23 within that. The reason I put it in that way is because
24 of the way Mr Hilliard put it in his, because he has
25 suggested at paragraph 54 that if you concluded that the
209
1 evidence supported leaving a short-form verdict of
2 unlawful killing to the jury, then he was submitting
3 that all three forms should be --
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes, I know he did.
5 MR STERN: That's why I'm working on the basis that that's
6 rejected.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Let's just take it in steps from there
8 on. I fully understand, I think he is right if I were
9 to do that, suppose I were to be in agreement with you
10 that there is insufficient evidence safely to leave
11 a verdict of unlawful killing in relation to C2 and C12
12 which as we all understand for practical purposes here
13 is murder.
14 MR STERN: Yes.
15 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Are you saying -- well, you have said
16 I should leave lawful killing as a verdict because there
17 is sufficient evidence of that. Is that on the basis
18 that, if it's not unlawful killing, then it must be
19 lawful?
20 MR STERN: No, it's --
21 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: That there is no gap between the two.
22 MR STERN: There is clearly a gap between the two because it
23 will be for the jury to determine whether or not the
24 shots were justified in accordance with the standard of
25 proof.
210
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Do I not then, in that case, have
2 effectively to rehearse to the jury again -- not again
3 because I won't have done it if I have withdrawn
4 unlawful killing -- I then have to rehearse to the jury
5 all the questions of self-defence and reasonable belief,
6 both limbs.
7 MR STERN: You do, that is correct, but that would be
8 inevitable, in my submission, even if you left
9 a narrative, because if you left a narrative you would
10 have to leave a narrative on the central factual issue
11 which is whether or not the shots were justified, and if
12 you left a narrative issue on the shots were justified,
13 then it would only be right to do so by obviously
14 telling the jury what it is that it means, or -- or
15 and -- about self-defence. Because if you were to leave
16 a narrative question, for example, is it more likely
17 than not that each of the shots were fired in
18 self-defence? Something along those lines.
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: The justification for the shots is
20 contained in the answers to questions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5,
21 is it not?
22 MR STERN: No, with respect they are not. Because the first
23 issue is the honest belief of the officer.
24 These 3, 4, 5 questions do not contain any reference
25 to the honest belief of the officer. That is
211
1 a fundamental issue in relation to the lawfulness --
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Quite apart from these five questions
3 which may or may not be left, your submission is that
4 there should be a specific question saying: did the
5 officers genuinely believe that the person in front of
6 them presented an immediate mortal threat?
7 MR STERN: It will have to be phrased in accordance with
8 lawful killing direction, because if you, on this basis,
9 I am assuming that you have rejected unlawful killing on
10 the basis of the discussion we are having.
11 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: What I am bothered about, Mr Stern, and
12 what I need your help about, is how I leave such
13 direction without essentially creating the risk that
14 an unfavourable answer from the jury will effectively
15 inevitably produce by the back door a verdict of
16 unlawful killing.
17 MR STERN: That's precisely why I am submitting what I am
18 submitting, that you leave short-form verdicts --
19 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: I understand that.
20 MR STERN: -- and no narrative questions in relation to the
21 shots.
22 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: All right, I understand what you are
23 saying. That's really all.
24 MR STERN: That's all. Well, so far as the firearms
25 officers are concerned, yes.
212
1 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You are not concerned with anybody
2 else.
3 MR STERN: I am not concerned with anybody else.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: As far as the firearms officers are
5 concerned, no narrative questions at all?
6 MR STERN: Yes.
7 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well. I understand the point.
8 MR STERN: If I may say so, the short-form verdicts are --
9 I do not wish to recite cases that I have done, because
10 there is nothing more tedious, but I have been in a few
11 where -- and in each of them, that has been the course
12 that's been adopted. Doesn't mean to say that's the
13 right course, but short-form lawful and open.
14 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: And nothing else, and no alternative.
15 MR STERN: Fortunately in the ones I have been in, no.
16 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: You have been very successful.
17 MR STERN: Up to now, and hoping that -- yes. Anyway, that
18 is it, and we -- I know Ms Leek has also been in
19 a number of them, and she will be able to help you far
20 better than I on the narrative and all of those issues.
21 There is, if you like, I have the directions that
22 were given in the summing-up in the case of Bennett.
23 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Yes. I know Mr Hough knows a good deal
24 about that one.
25 MR STERN: Mr Hough joined us later on, yes, as did
213
1 Mr Mansfield, I think.
2 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Very well.
3 MR STERN: Those are my submissions.
4 SIR MICHAEL WRIGHT: Mr Stern, thank you very much. Your
5 timing as always is impeccable. Thank you very much
6 indeed.
7 Very well. Ms Leek, 9.30 tomorrow morning.
