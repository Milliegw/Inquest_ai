The main findings of this document are:

1. The judge, Sir Michael Wright, makes an order under section 4.2 of the Contempt of Court Act to prevent reporting of submissions made during the court proceedings until the jury returns their verdict.
2. A juror has a personal commitment that requires travel out of the country on December 11th (Wednesday), but the judge decides not to release the juror early, preferring to keep them until the end of the trial if possible.
3. The judge is inclined to ask the juror to remain at least until the end of their deliberations, rather than releasing them early, in order to avoid losing a juror and potentially disrupting the jury's decision-making process.

Overall, the document outlines the judge's decisions on matters related to the conduct of the trial, including reporting restrictions and the management of the jury.
