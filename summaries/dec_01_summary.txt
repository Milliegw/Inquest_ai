This document appears to be a transcript of a court hearing on December 1st, 2008. The main points discussed during the hearing are:

1. A proposed order under section 4.2 of the Contempt of Court Act, preventing publication of submissions and rulings until the jury delivers their verdict, to avoid prejudice to the jury's deliberations.
2. An issue regarding a juror who has a personal commitment that will require travel outside the country on December 11th. The court is considering asking this juror to remain for as long as possible to avoid losing them.
3. A statement provided by Commander Stewart addressing the Metropolitan Police response to certain events, which was requested by both Sir Michael Wright and Mr. Mansfield earlier in the case.

The hearing appears to be related to a trial where the court is seeking to balance the need for transparency with the need to protect the jury's deliberations and avoid prejudice.
